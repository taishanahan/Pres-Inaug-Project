                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Inaugural Addresses are the first opportunity for a president to speak to the
                        country and outline their agenda for the next four years. The issues brought
                        up in these speeches can serve as a barometer for what is most important to
                        the nation and the president that leads it. Although addresses vary in
                        length and tone, similarities can be found in the topics and themes brought
                        up by each president. By analyzing each inaugural address from President
                        William McKinley’s second in 1901 to President Joe Biden’s in 2021, our
                        research shows how political trends have varied over time and between
                        parties in the past one hundred and twenty years.</p>

                    <h2>The Team</h2>
                    <p><b>Preetam Bhamidipati</b>: Third-year computer science major and economics
                        minor from Northern Virginia. I took this class to further enhance my coding
                        skills and learn about digital humanities.</p>
                    <p><b>Jack Gutch</b>: Second-year finance and accounting major from Rochester,
                        New York. This course is a much different aspect of learning than my usual
                        coursework but has given me a comprehensive understanding in the field of
                        computer science and coding.</p>
                    <p><b>Tai Shanahan</b>: Third-year history and political science major from
                        Philadelphia, PA. Took this course as an introduction to coding and
                        computation that is typically overlooked in my field of study.</p>
