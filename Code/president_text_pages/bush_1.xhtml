            <h2>George W. Bush First Inaugural Address Saturday, January 20, 2001</h2>
            <div id="speech">

                  <p><span class="pred-P">President BUSH. Thank you all. Chief Justice Rehnquist,
                              President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguished
                              guests, and my fellow citizens: This peaceful transfer of authority is
                              rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we
                              affirm old traditions and make new beginnings. As I begin, I thank
                              President Clinton for his service to our Nation.</span></p>


                  <p>And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended
                        with grace.</p>


                  <p>I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America’s leaders have
                        come before me and so many will follow.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">We have a place, all of us, in a long story; a story we
                              continue, but whose end we will not see. It is the story of a new
                              world that became a friend and liberator of the old, the story of a
                              slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a
                              power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend
                              but not to conquer. It is the American story; a story of flawed and
                              fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring
                              ideals.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American
                              promise: that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that
                              no insignificant person was ever born.</span></p>


                  <p>Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And
                        though our Nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must
                        follow no other course.</p>


                  <p><span class="democracy">Through much of the last century, America’s faith in
                              freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed
                              upon the wind, taking root in many nations.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="democracy">Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our
                              country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity; an ideal we carry but
                              do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225
                              years, we have a long way yet to travel.</span></p>


                  <p>While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise—even the
                        justice—of our own country. <span class="education-N">The ambitions of some
                              Americans are limited by failing schools,</span><span class="unity-N">
                              and hidden prejudice, and the circumstances of their birth. And
                              sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent,
                              but not a country.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our
                              unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every
                              generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a
                              single nation of justice and opportunity.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy">I know this is within our reach, because we are guided by
                              a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His
                              image.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us
                              onward.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">America has never been united by blood or birth or soil.
                              We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us
                              above our interests, and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every
                              child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them.
                              And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country
                              more, not less, American.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our Nation’s
                              promise through civility, courage, compassion, and
                        character.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle
                              with a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us
                              good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be
                              petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear
                              small. But the stakes, for America, are never small. If our country
                              does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not
                              turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will
                              lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our
                              economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer
                        most.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not
                              a tactic or a sentiment. It is the determined choice of trust over
                              cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, if we keep it,
                              is a way to shared accomplishment.</span></p>


                  <p>America, at its best, is also courageous.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">Our national courage has been clear in times of
                              depression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common
                              good. Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers
                              will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of
                              blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them onto future
                              generations.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="education-N">Together we will reclaim America’s schools, before
                              ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.</span><span
                              class="regulation">We will reform Social Security and Medicare,
                              sparing our children from struggles we have the power to
                              prevent.</span><span class="tax-N">And we will reduce
                              taxes,</span><span class="economy-N">to recover the momentum of our
                              economy and reward the efforts and enterprise of working
                              Americans.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-P">We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness
                              invite challenge.</span></p>



                  <p><span class="war-P">We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new
                              century is spared new horrors.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-P">The enemies of liberty and our country should make no
                              mistake, America remains engaged in the world, by history and by
                              choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We will defend
                              our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance.
                              We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And
                              to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our Nation
                              birth.</span></p>


                  <p>America, at its best, is compassionate.</p>


                  <p><span class="economy-N">In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep,
                              persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation’s promise.</span> And
                        whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not
                        at fault. Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God; they are failures of
                        love.</p>


                  <p><span class="criminal_justice-N">And the proliferation of prisons, however
                              necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our
                        souls.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in
                              need are not strangers, they are citizens; not problems, but
                              priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are
                        hopeless.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="public_health-P">Government has great responsibilities, for public
                              safety and public health,</span><span class="criminal_justice-P">for
                              civil rights</span><span class="education-P">and common
                              schools.</span> Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a
                        government. And some needs and hurts are so deep, they will only respond to
                        a mentor’s touch or a pastor’s prayer. <span class="economy">Church and
                              charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and
                              they will have an honored place in our plans and in our
                        laws.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy-N">Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty.
                              But we can listen to those who do. And I can pledge our Nation to a
                              goal.</span><span class="economy">When we see that wounded traveler on
                              the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.</span></p>


                  <p>America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and
                        expected.</p>


                  <p>Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats; it is a call to
                        conscience. And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper
                        fulfillment. We find the fullness of life, not only in options, but in
                        commitments. <span class="unity-P">And we find that children and community
                              are the commitments that set us free.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">Our public interest depends on private character; on
                              civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness; on uncounted,
                              unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.
                              Sometimes in life we are called to do great things. But as a saint of
                              our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with
                              great love.</span><span class="democracy">The most important tasks of
                              a democracy are done by everyone.</span></p>


                  <p>I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with
                        civility; to pursue the public interest with courage; to speak for greater
                        justice and compassion; to call for responsibility, and try to live it as
                        well. In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care
                        of our times.</p>


                  <p>What you do is as important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a
                        com- mon good beyond your comfort; <span class="regulation">to defend needed
                              reforms against easy attacks;</span> to serve your Nation, beginning
                        with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens—citizens, not spectators;
                        citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens building communities of serv-
                        ice and a nation of character.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because
                              we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves.
                              When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can
                              replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against
                              it.</span></p>


                  <p>After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page
                        wrote to Thomas Jefferson:</p>


                  <p>We know the race is not to the swift nor the Battle to the Strong. Do you not
                        think an Angel rides in the Whirlwind and directs this Storm?</p>


                  <p>Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years
                        and changes accumulate, but the themes of this day he would know: our
                        Nation’s grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity. We are not
                        the story’s author, who fills time and eternity with His purpose. Yet His
                        purpose is achieved in our duty; and our duty is fulfilled in service to one
                        another.</p>


                  <p>Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today: to
                        make our country more just and generous; to affirm the dignity of our lives
                        and every life. This work continues.</p>


                  <p>This story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this
                        storm.</p>


                  <p>God bless you all, and God bless America.</p>
