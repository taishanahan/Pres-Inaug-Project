            <h2>Jimmy Carter Inaugural Address Thursday, January 20, 1977</h2>
            <div id="speech">

                  <p><span class="pred-P">FOR myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my
                              predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy">In this outward and physical ceremony we attest once
                              again to the inner and spiritual strength of our Nation. As my high
                              school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: "We must adjust to
                              changing times and still hold to unchanging principles."</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy">Here before me is the Bible used in the inauguration of
                              our first President, in 1789, and I have just taken the oath of office
                              on the Bible my mother gave me a few years ago, opened to a timeless
                              admonition from the ancient prophet Micah:</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy">"He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
                              the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to
                              walk humbly with thy God." (Micah 6:8)</span></p>


                  <p>This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication within our
                        Government, and a new spirit among us all. A President may sense and
                        proclaim that new spirit, but only a people can provide it.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">Two centuries ago our Nation's birth was a milestone in
                              the long quest for freedom, but the bold and brilliant dream which
                              excited the founders of this Nation still awaits its consummation. I
                              have no new dream to set forth today, but rather urge a fresh faith in
                              the old dream.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="democracy">Ours was the first society openly to define itself in
                              terms of both spirituality and of human liberty. It is that unique
                              self-definition which has given us an exceptional appeal, but it also
                              imposes on us a special obligation, to take on those moral duties
                              which, when assumed, seem invariably to be in our own best
                              interests.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">You have given me a great responsibility--to stay close
                              to you, to be worthy of you, and to exemplify what you are. Let us
                              create together a new national spirit of unity and trust. Your
                              strength can compensate for my weakness, and your wisdom can help to
                              minimize my mistakes.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">Let us learn together and laugh together and work
                              together and pray together, confident that in the end we will triumph
                              together in the right.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">The American dream endures. We must once again have full
                              faith in our country--and in one another. I believe America can be
                              better. We can be even stronger than before.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">Let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to
                              the basic principles of our Nation, for we know that if we despise our
                              own government we have no future.</span>
                        <span class="unity-P">We recall in special times when we have stood briefly,
                              but magnificently, united. In those times no prize was beyond our
                              grasp.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">But we cannot dwell upon remembered glory. We cannot
                              afford to drift. We reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an
                              inferior quality of life for any person. Our Government must at the
                              same time be both competent and compassionate.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="regulation">We have already found a high degree of personal
                              liberty, and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity.
                              Our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair, our
                              natural beauty preserved; the powerful must not persecute the weak,
                              and human dignity must be enhanced.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">We have learned that "more" is not necessarily "better,"
                              that even our great Nation has its recognized limits, and that we can
                              neither answer all questions nor solve all problems. We cannot afford
                              to do everything, nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the
                              future. So, together, in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the
                              common good, we must simply do our best.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="democracy">Our Nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at
                              home. And we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands
                              is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of
                              emulation.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">To be true to ourselves, we must be true to others. We
                              will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and
                              standards here at home, for we know that the trust which our Nation
                              earns is essential to our strength.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">The world itself is now dominated by a new spirit.
                              Peoples more numerous and more politically aware are craving and now
                              demanding their place in the sun--not just for the benefit of their
                              own physical condition, but for basic human rights.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">The passion for freedom is on the rise. Tapping this
                              new spirit, there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for America
                              to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just
                              and peaceful world that is truly humane.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">We are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so
                              sufficient that it need not be proven in combat--a quiet strength
                              based not merely on the size of an arsenal, but on the nobility of
                              ideas.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-P">We will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will
                              fight our wars against poverty, ignorance, and injustice--for those
                              are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably
                              marshaled.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-P">We are a purely idealistic Nation, but let no one confuse
                              our idealism with weakness.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-P">Because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate
                              of freedom elsewhere. Our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference
                              for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for
                              individual human rights. We do not seek to intimidate, but it is clear
                              that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be
                              inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well-being of all
                              people.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">The world is still engaged in a massive armaments race
                              designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential
                              adversaries. We pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit
                              the world's armaments to those necessary for each nation's own
                              domestic safety. And we will move this year a step toward ultimate
                              goal--the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this Earth. We urge
                              all other people to join us, for success can mean life instead of
                              death.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">Within us, the people of the United States, there is
                              evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence. And I join
                              in the hope that when my time as your President has ended, people
                              might say this about our Nation:</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy">--that we had remembered the words of Micah and renewed
                              our search for humility, mercy, and justice;</span></p>


                  <p><span class="race">--that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of
                              different race</span> and region and <span class="economy"
                              >religion</span>, and <span class="unity-P">where there had been
                              mistrust, built unity, with a respect for diversity;</span></p>


                  <p><span class="jobs-P">--that we had found productive work for those able to
                              perform it;</span></p>


                  <p>--that we had strengthened the American family, which is the basis of our
                        society;</p>


                  <p><span class="criminal_justice-N">--that we had ensured respect for the law, and
                              equal treatment under the law, for the weak and the powerful, for the
                              rich and the poor;</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">--and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their
                              own Government once again-.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">I would hope that the nations of the world might say
                              that we had built a lasting peace, built not on weapons of war but on
                              international policies which reflect our own most precious
                              values.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">These are not just my goals, and they will not be my
                              accomplishments, but the affirmation of our Nation's continuing moral
                              strength and our belief in an undiminished, ever-expanding American
                              dream.</span></p>
