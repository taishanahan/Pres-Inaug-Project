            <p>My fellow citizens:</p>
            
            
            <p>Today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal.</p>
            
            
            <p>This ceremony is held in the depth of winter, but by the words we speak and the
               faces we show the world, we force the spring. <span class="democracy">A spring reborn in the world's
                  oldest democracy, that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America. When
                  our founders boldly declared America's independence to the world, and our purposes
                  to the Almighty, they knew that America, to endure, would have to change. Not change
                  for change sake, but change to preserve America's ideals: life, liberty, the pursuit
                  of happiness.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>Though we march to the music of our time, our mission is timeless. <span class="unity-P">Each
                  generation of American's must define what it means to be an American.</span> <span class="pred-P">On
                  behalf of our nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century
                  of service to America</span>...and <span class="unity-P">I thank the millions of men and
                  women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism and
                  communism.</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="war-N">Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the Cold War assumes
                  new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom, but threatened
                  still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.</span>
               <span class="economy-N">Raised in unrivalled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still
                  the world's strongest, but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages,
                  increasing inequality</span>, and <span class="unity-N">deep divisions among *our own*
                  people.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news
               travelled slowly across the land by horseback, and across the ocean by boat. <span class="economy-P">Now the
                  sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around
                  the
                  world. Communications and commerce are global. Investment is mobile. Technology is
                  almost magical, and ambition for a better life is now universal.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all
               across the Earth. Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world,
               and
               the *urgent* question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not
               our
               enemy. This new world has already enriched the lives of *millions* of Americans who
               are
               able to compete and win in it. But when most people are working harder for less, when
               others cannot work at all, <span class="public_health-N">when the cost of health care
                  devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and
                  small;</span>
               <span class="criminal_justice-N">when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their
                  freedom;</span> and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine
               the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend.</p>
            
            
            <p>We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done
               so. <span class="economy-N">Instead we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our
                  resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence.</span>
               <span class="unity-N">Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths. Americans have
                  ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people, and we must bring to our task today
                  the vision and will of those who came before us. </span>
               <span class="democracy">From our Revolution to the Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the Civil
                  Rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from
                  these crises the pillars of our history. Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve
                  the very foundations of our nation we would need dramatic change from time to
                  time.</span>
               <span class="unity-P">Well, my fellow Americans, this is OUR time. Let us embrace
                  it.</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="democracy">Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of
                  our *own* renewal.</span> There is nothing *wrong* with America that cannot be
               cured by what is *right* with America.</p>
            
            
            <p>And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift, and a new season
               of American renewal has begun.</p>
            
            
            <p>To renew America we must be bold. We must do what no generation has had to do
               before. We must invest more in our own people, <span class="jobs-P">in their jobs</span>, and
               in their future, and <span class="economy-N">at the same time cut our massive
                  debt</span>...and we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every
               opportunity. It will not be easy. It will require sacrifice, but it can be done, and
               done fairly. Not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for *our* own sake. <span class="unity-P">We must
                  provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children. Our founders saw
                  themselves in the light of posterity. We can do no less.</span> Anyone who has ever watched a
               child's eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is. Posterity is the world to
               come,
               the world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and
               to
               whom we bear sacred responsibilities. We must do what America does best, offer more
               opportunity TO all and demand more responsibility *from* all.</p>
            
            
            <p>It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing: from our
               government, or from each other. Let us all take more responsibility, not only for
               ourselves and our families, but for our communities and our country. <span class="democracy">To renew
                  America we must revitalize our democracy.</span> This beautiful capitol, like
               every capitol since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and
               calculation. Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is
               *in*
               and who is *out*, who is *up* and who is *down*, forgetting those people whose toil
               and
               sweat sends us here and paves our way.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="unity-P">Americans deserve better, and in this city today there are people
                  who want to do better, and so I say to all of you here, let us resolve to reform our
                  politics, so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people.
                  Let us put aside personal advantage, so that we can feel the pain and see the
                  promise of America. Let us resolve to make our government a place for what Franklin
                  Roosevelt called "bold, persistent experimentation, a government for our tomorrows,
                  not our yesterdays." Let us give this capitol back to the people to whom it
                  belongs.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>To renew America we must meet challenges abroad, as well as at home.
               <span class="diplomacy">There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is
                  domestic. The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world
                  arms race: they affect us all. Today as an old order passes, the new world is more
                  free, but less stable. Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities, and
                  new dangers. Clearly, America must continue to lead the world we did so much to
                  make. While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor
                  fail to seize the opportunities of this new world. Together with our friends and
                  allies, we will work together to shape change, lest it engulf us. When our vital
                  interests are challenged, or the will and conscience of the international community
                  is defied, we will act; with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when
                  necessary.</span>
               <span class="war-P">The brave Americans serving our nation today in the Persian Gulf, in
                  Somalia, and wherever else they stand, are testament to our resolve, but our
                  greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many lands.
                  Across the world, we see them embraced and we rejoice.</span>
               <span class="democracy">Our hopes, our hearts, our hands, are with those on every continent, who are
                  building democracy and freedom.</span> Their cause is America's cause. The
               American people have summoned the change we celebrate today. You have raised your
               voices
               in an unmistakable chorus, you have cast your votes in historic numbers, you have
               changed the face of congress, the presidency, and the political process itself. Yes,
               *you*, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring. Now *we* must do the work the
               season
               demands. To that work I now turn with *all* the authority of my office. <span class="congress">I ask
                  the congress to join with me; but no president, no congress, no government can
                  undertake *this* mission alone.</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="unity-P">My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our
                  renewal. I challenge a new generation of *young* Americans to a season of service,
                  to act on your idealism, by helping troubled children, keeping company with those
                  in
                  need, reconnecting our torn communities. There is so much to be done. Enough,
                  indeed, for millions of others who are still young in spirit, to give of themselves
                  in service, too. In serving we recognize a simple, but powerful, truth: we need each
                  other, and we must care for one another. Today we do more than celebrate America,
                  we
                  rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in revolution, and
                  renewed through two centuries of challenge, an idea tempered by the knowledge that
                  but for fate, we, the fortunate and the unfortunate, might have been each other; an
                  idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity, the
                  deepest measure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that America's journey
                  long, heroic journey must go forever upward.</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="unity-P">And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st
                  Century, let us begin anew, with energy and hope, with faith and discipline, and let
                  us work until our work is done.</span>
               <span class="religion">The Scripture says: "And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season
                  we shall reap, if we faint not." From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear
                  a call to service in the valley. We have heard the trumpets, we have changed the
                  guard, and now each in our own way, and with God's help, we must answer the
                  call.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>Thank you and God bless you all.</p>
