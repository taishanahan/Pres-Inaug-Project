      <h2>Franklin D. Roosevelt First Inaugural Address Saturday, March 4,
         1933</h2>
      
      <div class="tog-text">
         <div id="speech" class="flex-container">
            
            <p>I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the
               Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation
               of our Nation impels. This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole
               truth,
               frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country
               today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.
               <span class="unity-N">So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing
                  we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which
                  paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our
                  national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding
                  and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced
                  that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical
                  days.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They
               concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels;
               <span class="tax">taxes have risen</span>; <span class="economy-N">our ability to pay has fallen;
                  government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income</span>;
               <span class="trade">the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade</span>; <span class="economy-N">the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers
                  find no markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of
                  families are gone.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>More important, <span class="jobs-N">a host of unemployed citizens face the grim
                  problem of existence</span>, and an equally great number toil with little return.
               <span class="economy-N">Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague
               of locusts. <span class="unity-P">Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered
                  because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for.
                  Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it.</span> Plenty
               is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply.
               Primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed,
               through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure,
               and abdicated. <span class="criminal_justice-N">Practices of the unscrupulous money changers
                  stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of
                  men.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an
               outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending
               of
               more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow
               their
               false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored
               confidence. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no
               vision, and when there is no vision the people perish.</p>
            
            
            <p>The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our
               civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of
               the
               restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere
               monetary profit.</p>
            
            
            <p>Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of
               achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work
               no
               longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. <span class="unity-N">These
                  dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is
                  not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow
                  men.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes
               hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high
               political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal
               profit; and <span class="regulation">there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business
                  which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish
                  wrongdoing.</span> Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives
               only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection,
               on
               unselfish performance; without them it cannot live.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="unity-N">Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This
                  Nation asks for action, and action now.</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="jobs-P">Our greatest primary task is to put people to work.</span> This is
               no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished
               in
               part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would
               treat
               the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing
               greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural
               resources.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="infrastructure">Hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in
                  our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution,
                  endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land.</span>
               <span class="economy-N">The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of
                  agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities.
                  It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through
                  foreclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by insistence that
                  the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their
                  cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities
                  which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by
                  national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of
                  communications and other utilities which have a definitely public
                  character.</span> There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never
               be helped merely by talking about it. We must act and act quickly.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="regulation">Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two
                  safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order; there must be a strict
                  supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to
                  speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate
                  but sound currency.</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="congress">There are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new
                  Congress in special session detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall
                  seek the immediate assistance of the several States.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national
               house in order and making income balance outgo. <span class="trade">Our international trade
                  relations, though vastly important, are in point of time and necessity secondary to
                  the establishment of a sound national economy. I favor as a practical policy the
                  putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by
                  international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that
                  accomplishment.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not
               narrowly nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the
               interdependence of the various elements in all parts of the United States—a recognition
               of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the
               pioneer. It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest
               assurance that the recovery will endure.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="diplomacy">In the field of world policy I would dedicate this Nation to the
                  policy of the good neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and,
                  because he does so, respects the rights of others—the neighbor who respects his
                  obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of
                  neighbors.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never
               realized before our interdependence on each other; that we can not merely take but
               we
               must give as well; that if we are to go forward, <span class="war-P">we must move as a trained
                  and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because
                  without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective. We
                  are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline,
                  because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good. This I propose
                  to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred
                  obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed
                  strife.</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="war-P">With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of
                  this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common
                  problems.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government
               which we have inherited from our ancestors. <span class="democracy">Our Constitution is so simple and
                  practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in
                  emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our
                  constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political
                  mechanism the modern world has produced.</span> It has met every stress of vast
               expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world
               relations.</p>
            
            
            <p>It is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority
               may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that
               an
               unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure
               from
               that normal balance of public procedure.</p>
            
            
            <p>I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a
               stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. <span class="congress">These measures,
                  or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom,
                  I
                  shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy
                  adoption.</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="congress">But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two
                  courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not
                  evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress
                  for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis</span>—<span class="war-P">broad
                  Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that
                  would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.</span></p>
            
            
            <p>For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit
               the time. I can do no less.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="unity-P">We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage
                  of the national unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious
                  moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of
                  duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent
                  national life.</span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="democracy">We do not distrust the future of essential democracy.</span> The
               people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a
               mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline and
               direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes.
               In
               the spirit of the gift I take it.</p>
            
            
            <p>In this dedication of a Nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect
               each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.</p>
