            <h2>Richard Milhous Nixon First Inaugural Address Monday, January 20, 1969</h2>
            <div id="speech">

                  <p>Senator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President Johnson, Vice
                        President Humphrey, my fellow Americans--and my fellow citizens of the world
                        community:</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this
                              moment. In the orderly transfer of power, we celebrate the unity that
                              keeps us free.</span></p>


                  <p>Each moment in history is a fleeting time, precious and unique. But some stand
                        out as moments of beginning, in which courses are set that shape decades or
                        centuries.</p>


                  <p>This can be such a moment.</p>


                  <p>Forces now are converging that make possible, for the first time, the hope that
                        many of man's deepest aspirations can at last be realized. The spiraling
                        pace of change allows us to contemplate, within our own lifetime, advances
                        that once would have taken centuries.</p>


                  <p>In throwing wide the horizons of space, we have discovered new horizons on
                        earth.</p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">For the first time, because the people of the world want
                              peace, and the leaders of the world are afraid of war, the times are
                              on the side of peace.</span></p>


                  <p>Eight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation.
                        Within the lifetime of most people now living, mankind will celebrate that
                        great new year which comes only once in a thousand years--the beginning of
                        the third millennium.</p>


                  <p>What kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we
                        shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our
                        actions and our choices.</p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of
                              peacemaker. This honor now beckons America--the chance to help lead
                              the world at last out of the valley of turmoil, and onto that high
                              ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of
                              civilization.</span></p>


                  <p>If we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered
                        our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind.</p>


                  <p>This is our summons to greatness.</p>


                  <p>I believe the American people are ready to answer this call.</p>


                  <p>The second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement. <span
                              class="infrastructure">We have made enormous strides in science and
                              industry and agriculture.</span>
                        <span class="economy-P">We have shared our wealth more broadly than ever. We
                              have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its
                              continued growth.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="race">We have given freedom new reach, and we have begun to make
                              its promise real for black as well as for white.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="education-P">We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today. I
                              know America's youth. I believe in them. We can be proud that they are
                              better educated, more committed, more passionately driven by
                              conscience than any generation in our history.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="regulation">No people has ever been so close to the achievement of
                              a just and abundant society, or so possessed of the will to achieve
                              it. Because our strengths are so great, we can afford to appraise our
                              weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="pred-P">Standing in this same place a third of a century ago,
                              Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a Nation ravaged by depression and
                              gripped in fear. He could say in surveying the Nation's troubles:
                              "They concern, thank God, only material things."</span></p>


                  <p>Our crisis today is the reverse.</p>


                  <p><span class="economy-P">We have found ourselves rich in goods,</span> but
                        ragged in spirit; reaching with magnificent precision for the moon, but
                        falling into raucous discord on earth.</p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">We are caught in war, wanting peace.</span>
                        <span class="unity-N">We are torn by division, wanting unity.</span> We see
                        around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment. We see tasks that need doing,
                        waiting for hands to do them.</p>


                  <p><span class="economy">To a crisis of the spirit, we need an answer of the
                              spirit.</span></p>


                  <p>To find that answer, we need only look within ourselves.</p>


                  <p>When we listen to "the better angels of our nature," we find that they
                        celebrate the simple things, the basic things--such as goodness, decency,
                        love, kindness.</p>


                  <p>Greatness comes in simple trappings.</p>


                  <p>The simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what
                        divides us, and cement what unites us.</p>


                  <p>To lower our voices would be a simple thing.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">In these difficult years, America has suffered from a
                              fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can
                              deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from
                              bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting
                              at one another--until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be
                              heard as well as our voices.</span></p>


                  <p>For its part, government will listen. We will strive to listen in new ways--to
                        the voices of quiet anguish, the voices that speak without words, the voices
                        of the heart--to the injured voices, the anxious voices, the voices that
                        have despaired of being heard.</p>


                  <p>Those who have been left out, we will try to bring in.</p>


                  <p>Those left behind, we will help to catch up.</p>


                  <p><span class="regulation">For all of our people, we will set as our goal the
                              decent order that makes progress possible and our lives
                        secure.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="regulation">As we reach toward our hopes, our task is to build on
                              what has gone before--not turning away from the old, but turning
                              toward the new.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="regulation">In this past third of a century, government has passed
                              more laws, spent more money, initiated more programs, than in all our
                              previous history.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="regulation">In pursuing our goals of full employment, better
                              housing, excellence in education; in rebuilding our cities and
                              improving our rural areas; in protecting our environment and enhancing
                              the quality of life--in all these and more, we will and must press
                              urgently forward.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">We shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be
                              transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of
                              our people at home.</span></p>


                  <p>The American dream does not come to those who fall asleep.</p>


                  <p>But we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do.</p>


                  <p>Our greatest need now is to reach beyond government, and to enlist the legions
                        of the concerned and the committed.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">What has to be done, has to be done by government and
                              people together or it will not be done at all. The lesson of past
                              agony is that without the people we can do nothing; with the people we
                              can do everything.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">To match the magnitude of our tasks, we need the energies
                              of our people--enlisted not only in grand enterprises, but more
                              importantly in those small, splendid efforts that make headlines in
                              the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy">With these, we can build a great cathedral of the
                              spirit--each of us raising it one stone at a time, as he reaches out
                              to his neighbor, helping, caring, doing.</span></p>


                  <p>I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease. I do not call for a life of grim
                        sacrifice. I ask you to join in a high adventure--one as rich as humanity
                        itself, and as exciting as the times we live in.</p>


                  <p>The essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own
                        destiny.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself, no
                              man is truly whole.</span></p>


                  <p>The way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents; we achieve nobility in the
                        spirit that inspires that use.</p>


                  <p>As we measure what can be done, we shall promise only what we know we can
                        produce, but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-N">No man can be fully free while his neighbor is not. To go
                              forward at all is to go forward together.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="race">This means black and white together, as one nation, not two.
                              The laws have caught up with our conscience. What remains is to give
                              life to what is in the law: to ensure at last that as all are born
                              equal in dignity before God, all are born equal in dignity before
                              man.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">As we learn to go forward together at home, let us also
                              seek to go forward together with all mankind.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">Let us take as our goal: where peace is unknown, make it
                              welcome; where peace is fragile, make it strong; where peace is
                              temporary, make it permanent.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">After a period of confrontation, we are entering an era
                              of negotiation.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">Let all nations know that during this administration
                              our lines of communication will be open.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="trade">We seek an open world--open to ideas, open to the exchange
                              of goods</span>
                        <span class="immigration-P">and people--a world in which no people, great or
                              small, will live in angry isolation.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">We cannot expect to make everyone our friend, but we
                              can try to make no one our enemy.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">Those who would be our adversaries, we invite to a peaceful
                              competition--not in conquering territory or extending dominion, but in
                              enriching the life of man.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">As we explore the reaches of space, let us go to the
                              new worlds together--not as new worlds to be conquered, but as a new
                              adventure to be shared.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">With those who are willing to join, let us cooperate to
                              reduce the burden of arms, to strengthen the structure of peace, to
                              lift up the poor and the hungry.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-P">But to all those who would be tempted by weakness, let us
                              leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long
                              as we need to be.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">Over the past twenty years, since I first came to this
                              Capital as a freshman Congressman, I have visited most of the nations
                              of the world.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">I have come to know the leaders of the world, and the
                              great forces, the hatreds, the fears that divide the world.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">I know that peace does not come through wishing for
                              it--that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and
                              prolonged diplomacy.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">I also know the people of the world.</span></p>


                  <p>I have seen the hunger of a homeless child, the pain of a man wounded in
                        battle, the grief of a mother who has lost her son. I know these have no
                        ideology, no race.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">I know America. I know the heart of America is
                              good.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">I speak from my own heart, and the heart of my country,
                              the deep concern we have for those who suffer, and those who
                              sorrow.</span></p>


                  <p>I have taken an oath today in the presence of God and my countrymen to uphold
                        and defend the Constitution of the United States. <span class="war-N">To
                              that oath I now add this sacred commitment: I shall consecrate my
                              office, my energies, and all the wisdom I can summon, to the cause of
                              peace among nations.</span></p>


                  <p>Let this message be heard by strong and weak alike:</p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">The peace we seek to win is not victory over any other
                              people, but the peace that comes "with healing in its wings"; with
                              compassion for those who have suffered; with understanding for those
                              who have opposed us; with the opportunity for all the peoples of this
                              earth to choose their own destiny.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">Only a few short weeks ago, we shared the glory of man's
                              first sight</span> of <span class="economy">the world as God sees it,
                              as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness.</span></p>


                  <p>As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon's gray surface on Christmas Eve,
                        they spoke to us of the beauty of earth--and in that voice so clear across
                        the lunar distance, <span class="economy">we heard them invoke God's
                              blessing on its goodness.</span></p>


                  <p>In that moment, their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to
                        write:</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">"To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and
                              beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves
                              as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in
                              the eternal cold--brothers who know now they are truly
                              brothers."</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">In that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men
                              turned their thoughts toward home and humanity--seeing in that far
                              perspective that man's destiny on earth is not divisible; telling us
                              that however far we reach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in the
                              stars but on Earth itself, in our own hands, in our own
                        hearts.</span></p>


                  <p>We have endured a long night of the American spirit. But as our eyes catch the
                        dimness of the first rays of dawn, let us not curse the remaining dark. Let
                        us gather the light.</p>


                  <p>Our destiny offers, not the cup of despair, but the chalice of opportunity. So
                        let us seize it, not in fear, but in gladness--and, "riders on the earth
                        together," let us go forward, firm in our faith, steadfast in our purpose,
                        cautious of the dangers; but sustained by our confidence in the will of God
                        and the promise of man.</p>
