            <h2>Ronald Reagan First Inaugural Address Tuesday, January 20, 1981</h2>
            <div id="speech">


                  <p>Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice
                        President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill, Reverend Moomaw, and my
                        fellow citizens: To a few of us here today, this is a solemn and most
                        momentous occasion; and yet, in the history of our Nation, it is a
                        commonplace occurrence. <span class="democracy">The orderly transfer of
                              authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place as
                              it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique
                              we really are. In the eyes of many in the world, this every-4-year
                              ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a
                        miracle.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="pred-P">Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much
                              you did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in
                              the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a
                              united people pledged to maintaining a political system which
                              guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and
                              I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the
                              continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy-N">The business of our nation goes forward. These United
                              States are confronted with an economic affliction of great
                              proportions. We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained
                              inflations in our national history. It distorts our economic
                              decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the
                              fixed-income elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of
                              millions of our people.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="jobs-N">Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment,
                              causing human misery and personal indignity.</span>
                        <span class="tax-N">Those who do work are denied a fair return for their
                              labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps
                              us from maintaining full productivity.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="tax-N">But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with
                              public spending. For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit,
                              mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary
                              convenience of the present. To continue this long trend is to
                              guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic
                              upheavals.</span></p>


                  <p>You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for
                        only a limited period of time. <span class="unity-P">Why, then, should we
                              think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same
                              limitation?</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let
                              there be no misunderstanding—we are going to begin to act, beginning
                              today.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy-N">The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over
                              several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but
                              they will go away.</span>
                        <span class="unity-P">They will go away because we, as Americans, have the
                              capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs to be
                              done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.</span></p>


                  <p>In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.</p>


                  <p>From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society has become too
                        complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is
                        superior to government for, by, and of the people. But if no one among us is
                        capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern
                        someone else? All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the
                        burden. The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled
                        out to pay a higher price.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">We hear much of special interest groups. Our concern must
                              be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It
                              knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it
                              crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and women who
                              raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and our factories,
                              teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we are
                              sick—professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and
                              truckdrivers. They are, in short, "We the people," this breed called
                              Americans.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy-N">Well, this administration's objective will be a
                              healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunity for
                              all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or
                              discrimination.</span>
                        <span class="jobs-N">Putting America back to work means putting all
                              Americans back to work.</span>
                        <span class="economy-N">Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from
                              the terror of runaway living costs. All must share in the productive
                              work of this "new beginning" and all must share in the bounty of a
                              revived economy.</span> With the idealism and fair play which are the
                        core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous
                        America at peace with itself and the world.</p>


                  <p>So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has a
                        government—not the other way around. And this makes us special among the
                        nations of the Earth. <span class="democracy">Our Government has no power
                              except that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse
                              the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the
                              consent of the governed.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="democracy">It is my intention to curb the size and influence of
                              the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction
                              between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those
                              reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded
                              that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States
                              created the Federal Government.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="democracy">Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my
                              intention to do away with government. It is, rather, to make it
                              work—work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our
                              back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it;
                              foster productivity, not stifle it.</span></p>


                  <p>If we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved so much,
                        prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because here, in this land, we
                        unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than
                        has ever been done before. Freedom and the dignity of the individual have
                        been more available and assured here than in any other place on Earth. The
                        price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been
                        unwilling to pay that price.</p>


                  <p>It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate
                        to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary
                        and excessive growth of government. <span class="unity-P">It is time for us
                              to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small
                              dreams. We are not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an
                              inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no
                              matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we
                              do nothing. So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us
                              begin an era of national renewal. Let us renew our determination, our
                              courage, and our strength. And let us renew our faith and our
                              hope.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say
                              that we are in a time when there are no heroes just don't know where
                              to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory
                              gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of
                              us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a counter—and
                              they are on both sides of that counter. There are entrepreneurs with
                              faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new
                              wealth and opportunity. They are individuals and families whose taxes
                              support the Government and whose voluntary gifts support church,
                              charity, culture, art, and education. Their patriotism is quiet but
                              deep. Their values sustain our national life.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">I have used the words "they" and "their" in speaking of
                              these heroes. I could say "you" and "your" because I am addressing the
                              heroes of whom I speak—you, the citizens of this blessed land. Your
                              dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes,
                              and the goals of this administration, so help me God.</span></p>


                  <p>We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup. <span
                              class="unity-N">How can we love our country and not love our
                              countrymen, and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal
                              them when they are sick, and provide opportunities to make them
                              self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in
                              theory?</span></p>


                  <p>Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is an unequivocal
                        and emphatic "yes." To paraphrase Winston Churchill, <span class="economy-P"
                              >I did not take the oath I have just taken with the intention of
                              presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest
                              economy.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="economy-N">In the days ahead I will propose removing the
                              roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced
                              productivity.</span> Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the
                        balance between the various levels of government. Progress may be
                        slow—measured in inches and feet, not miles—but we will progress. <span
                              class="economy-N">Is it time to reawaken this industrial giant</span>,
                              <span class="democracy">to get government back within its
                        means</span>, and <span class="tax-">to lighten our punitive tax
                              burden</span>. And these will be our first priorities, and on these
                        principles, there will be no compromise.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who
                              might have been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr.
                              Joseph Warren, President of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his
                              fellow Americans, "Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired
                              of.... On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide the
                              important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of
                              millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves."</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to
                              act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure
                              happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children and our children's
                              children.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will
                              be seen as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again
                              be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not
                              now have freedom.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we
                              will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and
                              firm commitment. We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive
                              for mutually beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to
                              impose on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for
                              sale.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="diplomacy">As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential
                              adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest
                              aspiration of the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice
                              for it; we will not surrender for it—now or ever.</span></p>


                  <p>Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance for conflict
                        should not be misjudged as a failure of will. <span class="war-P">When
                              action is required to preserve our national security, we will
                              act.</span> We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need
                        be, knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use
                        that strength.</p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon
                              in the arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral
                              courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in
                              today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do
                              have.</span> Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism
                        and prey upon their neighbors.</p>


                  <p><span class="economy">I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are
                              being held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a
                              nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free. It
                              would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration Day in
                              future years it should be declared a day of prayer.</span></p>


                  <p>This is the first time in history that this ceremony has been held, as you have
                        been told, on this West Front of the Capitol. Standing here, one faces a
                        magnificent vista, opening up on this city's special beauty and history. At
                        the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders
                        we stand.</p>


                  <p><span class="democracy">Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental
                              man: George Washington, Father of our country. A man of humility who
                              came to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary
                              victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial
                              to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with his
                              eloquence.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="democracy">And then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified
                              columns of the Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart
                              the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham
                              Lincoln.</span></p>


                  <p>Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and <span class="war-N"
                              >on the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery
                              with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars
                              of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has
                              been paid for our freedom.</span></p>


                  <p>Each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero I spoke of
                        earlier. <span class="war-N">Their lives ended in places called Belleau
                              Wood, The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno and halfway around the world
                              on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir, and in a
                              hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">Under one such marker lies a young man—Martin Treptow—who
                              left his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with
                              the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was killed
                              trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery
                              fire.</span></p>


                  <p>We are told that on his body was found a diary. <span class="unity-P">On the
                              flyleaf under the heading, "My Pledge," he had written these words:
                              "America must win this war. Therefore, I will work, I will save, I
                              will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my
                              utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me
                              alone."</span></p>


                  <p><span class="war-N">The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the
                              kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others
                              were called upon to make.</span>
                        <span class="unity-P">It does require, however, our best effort, and our
                              willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to
                              perform great deeds; to believe that together, with God's help, we can
                              and will resolve the problems which now confront us.</span></p>


                  <p><span class="unity-P">And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are
                              Americans.</span> God bless you, and thank you.</p>
