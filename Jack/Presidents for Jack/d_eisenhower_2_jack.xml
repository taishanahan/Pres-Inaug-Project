    <introduction>Dwight D. Eisenhower Second Inaugural Address Monday, <date>January 21,
            1957</date></introduction>
    <speech>
        <paragraph> Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Speaker, members of my
            family and friends, my countrymen, and thea friends of my country, wherever they may be,
            we meet again, as upon a like moment four years ago, and again you have witnessed my
            solemn oath of service to you.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>I, too, am a witness, today testifying in your name to the principles and <unity
                tone="P">purposes to which we, as a people, are pledged.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Before all else, <religion>we seek, upon our common labor as a nation, the
                blessings of Almighty God</religion>. And the hopes in our hearts fashion the
            deepest prayers of our whole people.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>May we pursue the right—without self-righteousness.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">May we know unity—without conformity.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>May we grow in strength—without pride in self.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>May we, in our dealings with all peoples of the earth, ever speak truth and serve
            justice.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">And so shall America—in the sight of all men of good will—prove true to the
            honorable purposes that bind and rule us as a people in all this time of trial through
            which we pass.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph>We live in a land of plenty, but <unity tone="N">rarely has this earth known such
                peril as today.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>In our nation work and wealth abound. Our population grows. <economy tone="P"
                >Commerce crowds our rivers and rails, our skies, harbors, and highways. Our soil is
                fertile, our agriculture productive. The air rings with the song of our
                industry—rolling mills and blast furnaces, dynamos, dams, and assembly lines—the
                chorus of America the bountiful.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">This is our home—yet this is not the whole of our world.</unity>
            For our world is where our full destiny lies—with men, of all people, and all nations,
            who are or would be free. And for them—and so for us—this is no time of ease or of
            rest.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">In too much of the earth there is want, discord, danger. New
                forces and new nations stir and strive across the earth, with power to bring, by
                their fate, great good or great evil to the free world's future</unity>. From the
            deserts of North Africa to the islands of the South Pacific one third of all mankind has
            entered upon an historic struggle for a new freedom; freedom from grinding poverty.
            Across all continents, nearly a billion people seek, sometimes almost in desperation,
            for the skills and knowledge and assistance by which they may satisfy from their own
            resources, the material wants common to all mankind.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">No nation, however old or great, escapes this tempest of change
                and turmoil</unity>. Some, impoverished by the recent World War, seek to restore
            their means of livelihood. <war tone="N">In the heart of Europe, Germany still stands tragically
            divided. So is the whole continent divided. And so, too, is all the world.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">The divisive force is International Communism and the power that
                it controls.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>The designs of that power, dark in purpose, are clear in practice. It strives to
            seal forever the fate of those it has enslaved. It strives to break the ties that unite
            the free. <war tone="N">And it strives to capture—to exploit for its own greater power—all forces of
            change in the world, especially the needs of the hungry and the hopes of the
            oppressed.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Yet the world of International Communism has itself been shaken by a fierce and
            mighty force: <unity tone="P">the readiness of men who love freedom to pledge their
                lives to that love.</unity> Through the night of their bondage, the unconquerable
            will of heroes has struck with the swift, sharp thrust of lightning. Budapest is no
            longer merely the name of a city; henceforth it is a new and shining symbol of man's
            yearning to be free.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Thus across all the globe there harshly blow the winds of change. And, we—though
            fortunate be our lot—know that we can never turn our backs to them.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We look upon this shaken earth, and we declare our firm and fixed
                purpose—<unity tone="P">the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law
                prevails.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>The building of such a peace is a bold and solemn purpose. To proclaim it is
            easy. To serve it will be hard. And to attain it, we must be aware of its full
            meaning—and ready to pay its full price. <unity tone="P"> We know clearly what we seek,
                and why.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We seek peace, knowing that peace is the climate of freedom. And now, as
                in no other age, we seek it because we have been warned, by the power of modern
                weapons, that peace may be the only climate possible for human life
            itself.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Y<unity tone="P">et this peace we seek cannot be born of fear alone: it must be rooted in
                the lives of nations. There must be justice, sensed and shared by all peoples, for,
                without justice the world can know only a tense and unstable truce. </unity>There
            must be law, steadily invoked and respected by all nations, for without law, the world
            promises only such meager justice as the pity of the strong upon the weak. But the law
            of which we speak, comprehending the values of freedom, affirms the equality of all
            nations, great and small.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Splendid as can be the blessings of such a peace, high will be its cost: in toil
            patiently sustained, in help honorably given, in sacrifice calmly borne.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We are called to meet the price of this peace.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">To counter the threat of those who seek to rule by force, we must pay the costs
            of our own needed military strength, and help to build the security of
            others</war>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We must use our skills and knowledge and, at times, our
                substance, to help others rise from misery, however far the scene of suffering may
                be from our shores. </unity>For wherever in the world a people knows desperate want,
            there must appear at least the spark of hope, the hope of progress—or there will surely
            rise at last the flames of conflict.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We recognize and accept our own deep involvement in the destiny of men
            everywhere. <unity tone="P">We are accordingly pledged to honor, and to strive to fortify, the
                authority of the United Nations</unity>. For in that body rests the best hope of our
            age for the assertion of that law by which all nations may live in dignity.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">And, beyond this general resolve, we are called to act a responsible role in the
            world's great concerns or conflicts—whether they touch upon the affairs of a vast
            region, the fate of an island in the Pacific, or the use of a canal in the Middle East.</war>
            <democracy>Only in respecting the hopes and cultures of others will we practice the equality of all
            nations.</democracy> Only as we show willingness and wisdom in giving counsel—in receiving
            counsel—and in sharing burdens, will we wisely perform the work of peace.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>For one truth must rule all we think and all we do. No people can live to itself
            alone. The unity of all who dwell in freedom is their only sure defense. The economic
            need of all nations—in mutual dependence—makes isolation an impossibility; not even
            America's prosperity could long survive if other nations did not also prosper. No nation
            can longer be a fortress, lone and strong and safe. And any people, seeking such shelter
            for themselves, can now build only their own prison.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Our pledge to these principles is constant, because we believe in
                their rightness</unity>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We do not fear this world of change. America is no stranger to much of its
            spirit. Everywhere we see the seeds of the same growth that America itself has known.
            The American experiment has, for generations, fired the passion and the courage of
            millions elsewhere seeking freedom, equality, and opportunity. And the American story of
            material progress has helped excite the longing of all needy peoples for some
            satisfaction of their human wants. These hopes that we have helped to inspire, we can
            help to fulfill.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>In this confidence, we speak plainly to all peoples.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We cherish our friendship with all nations that are or would be free. We respect,
            no less, their independence. And when, in time of want or peril, they ask our help, they
            may honorably receive it; for we no more seek to buy their sovereignty than we would
            sell our own. Sovereignty is never bartered among freemen.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We honor the aspirations of those nations which, now captive, long for freedom.
            <war tone="N">We seek neither their military alliance nor any artificial imitation of our society. And
            they can know the warmth of the welcome that awaits them when, as must be, they join
            again the ranks of freedom.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We honor, no less in this divided world than in a less tormented
                time, the people of Russia</unity>.<education tone="P"> We do not dread, rather do
                we welcome, their progress in education and industry.</education> We wish them
            success in their demands for more intellectual freedom, greater security before their
            own laws, fuller enjoyment of the rewards of their own toil. <unity tone="P">For as such things
                come to pass, the more certain will be the coming of that day when our peoples may
                freely meet in friendship.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">So we voice our hope and our belief that we can help to heal this divided world.
            Thus may the nations cease to live in trembling before the menace of force. Thus may the
            weight of fear and the weight of arms be taken from the burdened shoulders of
            mankind</war>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>This, nothing less, is the labor to which we are called and our strength
            dedicated.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>And so the prayer of our people carries far beyond our own frontiers, to the wide
            world of our duty and our destiny.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>May the light of freedom, coming to all darkened lands, flame brightly—until at
            last the darkness is no more.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>May the turbulence of our age yield to a true time of peace,<unity tone="P"> when
                men and nations shall share a life that honors the dignity of each, the brotherhood
                of all. </unity></paragraph>
