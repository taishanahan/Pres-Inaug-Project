    President CLINTON. My fellow citi-
    zens, today, we celebrate the mystery
    of American renewal.
    This ceremony is held in the depth of
    winter. But, by the words we speak and
    the faces we show the world, we force
    the spring.
    A spring reborn in the world 's oldest
    democracy, that brings forth the vision
    and courage to reinvent America.
    When our Founders boldly declared
    America's independence to the world
    and our purposes to the Almighty, they
    knew America, to endure, would have
    to change.
    Not change for change's sake, but
    change to preserve America's ideals-
    life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.
    Though we march to the music of our
    time, our mission is timeless.
    Each generation of Americans must
    define what it means to be an Amer-
    ican.
    On behalf of our Nation, I salute my
    predecessor, President Bush, for his
    half-century of service to America.
    [Applause]. And I thank the millions of
    men and women whose steadfastness
    and sacrifice triumphed over depres-
    sion, fascism, and communism.
    Today, a generation raised in the
    shadows of the cold war assumes new
    responsibilities in a world warmed by
    the sunshine of freedom but threatened
    still by ancient hatreds and new
    plagues.
    Raised in unrivaled prosperity, we in-
    herit an economy that is still the
    world's strongest, but is weakened by
    business failures, stagnant wages, in-
    creasing inequality, and deep divisions
    among our own people. ,
    When George Washington first took
    the oath I have just sworn to uphold,
    news traveled slowly across the land by
    horseback and across the ocean by
    boat. Now, the sights and sounds of
    this ceremony are broadcast instanta-
    neously to billions around the world.
    Communications and commerce are
    global; investment is mobile; tech-
    nology is almost magical; and ambi-
    tion for a better life is now universal.
    We earn our livelihood in America
    today in peaceful competition with
    people all across the Earth.
    Profound and powerful forces are
    shaking and remaking our world, and
    the urgent question of our time is
    whether we can make change our
    friend and not our enemy.
    This new world has already enriched
    the lives of millions of Americans who
    are able to compete and win in it. But
    when most people are working harder
    for less; when others cannot work at
    all; when the cost of health care dev-
    astates families and threatens to bank-
    rupt our enterprises, great and small;
    when the fear of crime robs law-abiding
    citizens of their freedom; and when
    millions of poor children cannot even
    imagine the lives we are calling them
    to lead- we have not made change our
    friend.
    We know we have to face hard truths
    and take strong steps. But we have not
    done so. Instead, we have drifted, and
    that drifting has eroded our resources,
    fractured our economy, and shaken our
    confidence.
    Though our challenges are fearsome,
    so are our strengths . Americans have
    ever been a restless, questing, hopeful
    people. And we must bring to our task
    today the vision and will of those who
    came before us.
    From our Revolution to the Civil
    War, to the Great Depression, to the
    civil rights movement, our people have
    always mustered the determination to
    construct from these crises the pillars
    of our history.
    Thomas Jefferson believed that to
    preserve the very foundations of our
    Nation, we would need dramatic
    change from time to time. Well, my
    fellow Americans, this is our time. Let
    us embrace it. [Applause.]
    Our democracy must be not only the
    envy of the world but the engine of our
    own renewal. There is nothing wrong
    with America that cannot be cured by
    what is right with America. [Applause.]
    So today, we pledge an end to the era
    of deadlock and drift-and a new sea-
    son of American renewal has begun.
    [Applause.]
    To renew America, we must be bold.
    We must do what no generation has
    had to do before. We must invest more
    in our own people, in their jobs and in
    their future, and at the same time cut
    our massive debt. And we must do so in
    a world in which we must compete for
    every opportunity.
    It will not be easy; it will require
    sacrifice. But it can be done, and done
    fairly, not choosing sacrifice for its
    own sake, but for our own sake. We
    must provide for our Nation the way a
    family provides for its children.
    Our Founders saw themselves in the
    light of posterity. We can do no less.
    Anyone who has ever watched a child's
    eyes wander into sleep knows what pos-
    terity is. Posterity is the world to
    come-the world for whom we hold our
    ideals, from whom we have borrowed
    our planet, and to whom we bear sacred
    responsibility.
    We must do what America does best:
    offer more opportunity to all and de-
    mand more responsibility from all.
    [Applause.]
    It is time to break the bad habit of
    expecting something for nothing, from
    our Government or from each other.
    Let us all take more responsibility, not
    only for ourselves and our families but
    for our communities and our country.
    To renew America, we must revital-
    ize our democracy.
    This beautiful Capital , like every
    capital since the dawn of civilization,
    is often a place of intrigue and calcula-
    tion. Powerful people maneuver for po-
    sition and worry endlessly about who is
    in and who is out, who is up and who is
    down, forgetting those people whose
    toil and sweat sends us here and pays
    our way.
    Americans deserve better. And in
    this city, there are people who want to
    do better. And so I say to all of you
    here, let us resolve to reform our poli-
    tics, so that power and privilege no
    longer shout down the voice of the peo-
    ple. Let us put aside personal advan-
    tage so that we can feel the pain and
    see the promise of America.
    Let us resolve to make our Govern-
    ment a place for what Franklin Roo-
    sevelt called "bold, persistent experi-
    mentation," a government for our to-
    morrows, not our yesterdays.
    ' Let us give this Capital back to the
    people to whom it belongs. [Applause.]
    To renew America, we must meet
    challenges abroad as well as at home.
    There is no longer a clear division be-
    tween what is foreign and what is do-
    mestic-the world economy, the world
    environment, the world AIDS crisis,
    the world arms race, they affect us all.
    Today, as an old order passes, the
    new world is more free but less stable.
    Communism's collapse has called forth
    old animosities and new dangers. Clear-
    ly America must continue to lead the
    world we did so much to make.
    While America rebuilds at home, we
    will not shrink from the challenges,
    nor fail to seize the opportunities, of
    this new world. Together with our
    friends and allies, we will work to
    shape change, lest it engulf us.
    When our vital interests are chal-
    lenged, or the will and conscience of
    the international community is defied,
    we will act-with peaceful diplomacy
    whenever possible, with force when
    necessary. The brave Americans serv-
    ing our Nation today in the Persian
    Gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else
    they stand are testament to our re-
    solve.
    But our greatest strength is the
    power of our ideas, which are still new
    in many lands. Across the world, we
    see them embraced- and we rejoice.
    Our hopes, our hearts, and our hands,
    are with those on every continent who
    are building democracy and freedom.
    Their cause is America's cause.
    The American people have summoned
    the change we celebrate today. You
    have raised your voices in an unmis-
    takable chorus. You have cast your
    votes in historic numbers. And you
    have changed the face of the Congress,
    the Presidency, and the political proc-
    ess itself.
    Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have
    forced the spring.
    Now, we must do the work the season
    demands.
    To that work I now turn, with all the
    authority of my office. I ask the Con-
    gress to join with me. But no Presi-
    dent, no Congress, no government, can
    undertake this mission alone.
    My fellow Americans, you, too, must
    play your part in our renewal.
    I challenge a new generation of
    young Americans to a season of serv-
    ice-to act on your idealism by helping
    troubled children, keeping company
    with those in need, reconnecting our
    torn communities. There is so much to
    be done-enough indeed for millions of
    others who are still young in spirit to
    give of themselves in service, too.
    In serving, we recognize a simple but
    powerful truth: We need each other.
    And we must care for one another.
    Today, we do more than celebrate
    America; we rededicate ourselves to
    the very idea of America:
    An idea born in revolution and re-
    newed through two centuries of chal-
    lenge;
    An idea tempered by the knowledge
    that, but for fate, we-the fortunate
    and the unfortunate-might have been
    each other;
    An idea ennobled by the faith that
    our Nation can summon from its myr-
    iad diversity the deepest measure of
    unity;
    An idea infused with the conviction
    that America's long heroic journey
    must go forever upward.
    And so. my fellow Americans, as we
    stand at the edge of the 21st century,
    let us begin anew with energy and
    hope, with faith and discipline, and let
    us work until our work is done. The
    Scripture says "And let us not be
    weary in well-doing, for in due season,
    we shall reap, if we faint not."
    From this joyful mountaintop of
    celebration, we hear a call to service in
    the valley.
    We have heard the trumpets. We have
    changed the guard. And now-each in
    our own way, and with God's help-we
    must answer the call.
    Thank you, and God bless you all.
