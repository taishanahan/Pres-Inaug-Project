    My friends, before I begin the expres-
    sion of those thoughts which I deem
    appropriate to this moqtent, would you
    permit me the privilege of uttering a
    little private prayer of my own, and I ask
    that you bow your heads.
    Almighty God, as we stand here, at
    this moment, my future associates in the
    executive branch of Government join
    me in beseeching that Thou wilt make
    full and complete our dedication to the
    service of the people in this throng and
    their fellow citizens everywhere. Give
    us, we pray, the power to discern clearly
    right from wrong and allow all our words
    and actions to be governed thereby and
    by the laws of this land.
    Especially .we pray that our. concern
    shall be for all the people-regardless
    of station, race, or calling. May coopera-
    tion be permitted and be the mutual
    aim of those who, under the concepts
    of our Constitution, hold to differing po-
    litical beliefs, so that all may work for
    the good of our beloved country and for
    Thy glory. Amen.
    My fellow citizens, the world and we
    have passed the midway point of a cen-
    tury of continuing challenge. We sense
    with all our faculties that forces of good
    and evil are massed and armed and op-
    posed as rarely before in history.
    This fact defines the meaning of this
    day. We are summoned, by this hon-
    ored and historic ceremony. to witness
    more than the act of one citizen swear-
    ing his oath of service, in the presence of
    his God. We are called, as a people, to
    give testimony, in the sight of the world,
    to our faith that the future shall belong
    to the free.
    Since this century's beginning, a time
    of tempest has seemed to come upon the
    continents of the earth. Masses of Asia
    have wakened to strike off shackles of
    the past. Great nations of Europe have
    waged their bloodiest wars. Thrones
    have toppled and their vast empires have
    disappeared. New nations have been
    born.
    For our own country, it has been a
    time of recurring trial. We have grown
    in power and in responsibility. We have
    passed through the anxieties of depres 7
    sion and of war to a summit unmatched
    in man's history. Seeking to secure
    peace in the world, we have had to fight
    through the forests of the Argonne, to
    the shores of Iwo Jima, and to the moun-
    tain peaks of Korea.
    In the swift rush of great e.vents, we
    find ourselves groping to know the full
    sense and meaning of the times in which
    we live, In .our quest of understanding,
    we beseech God's guidance . .. We sum-
    mon all our knowledge of the past and
    we scan all signs of the future. We bring
    all our wit and will to meef the question:
    How far have we come in man's long
    pilgrimage from darkness toward light?
    Are we nearing the light-a day of free-
    dom and of peace for all mankind? Or
    are the shadows of another night closing
    in upon us?
    Great as are the preoccupations ab-
    sorbing us at home, concerned as we are
    with matters that deeply affect our liveli-
    hood today and our vision of the future,
    each of these domestic problems is
    qwarfed by, and often even created by,
    this question that involves all human
    kind.
    This trial comes at a moment when
    man's power to achieve good or to in-
    flict evil surpasses the brightest hopes
    and the sharpest fears of all ages. We
    can turn rivers in their. courses, level
    mountains to the plains. Ocean and
    land and sky are avenues for our colos-
    sal commerce. Disease diminishes and
    life lengthens.
    Yet, the promise of this life is imper-
    illed by the very genius that has made it
    possible. Nations amass wealth. Labor
    sweats to create-and turns out devices
    to level not· only mountains but also
    cities. Science . seems · ready to confer
    upon us, as its final gift, the power to
    erase human life from the earth.
    At such a time in history, we who are
    free must proclaim . anew our faith.
    This faith is the abiding creed of our
    fathers. It is our faith in the deathless
    dignity of man, governed by eternal
    moral and natural laws.
    This faith defines our full view of life.
    It establishes, beyond debate, those gifts
    of the Creator that are man's inalien-
    able rights, and that make all men
    equal in His sight.
    In the light of this equality, we know
    that the virtues most cherished by free
    people-love of tr"!lth, pride of work, de-
    votion to · country-all are treasures
    equally precious in the lives of the most
    humbled and of the most exalted. The
    men who mine coal and fire furnaces
    and balance ledgers and turn lathes and
    pick cotton and heal the sick and plant
    corn, all serve as proudly, and as profit-
    ably, for America as the statesmen who
    draft treaties or the legislators who en-
    act laws.
    This faith rules our whole way of life.
    It decrees that we, the people, elect lead-
    ers not to rule but to serve. It asserts
    that we have the right to choice of our
    own work and to the reward of our own
    toil. It inspires the initiative that makes
    our productivity the wonder of the world.
    And it warns that any man who seeks to
    deny equality in all his brothers betrays
    the spirit of the free and invites the
    mockery of the tyrant.
    It is because we, all of us, ·hold to these
    principles that the political changes ac-
    complished this day do not imply turbu-
    lence, upheaval, or disorder. Rather
    this change expresses a purpose of
    strengthening our dedication and devo-
    tion to the precepts of our founding
    documents, .a conscious renewal of faith
    in our country and in the watchfulness
    of a divine providence.
    The enemies of this faith know no god
    but force, no devotion but its use. They
    tutor men in treason. They feed upon
    the hunger of others. Whatever defies
    them, they torture, especially the truth.
    Here, then, is joined no pallid argu-
    ment between slightly differing philoso-
    phies. This conflict strikes directly at
    the faith of our fathers and the lives
    of our sons. No principle or treasure
    that we hold, from the spiritual knowl-
    edge of our free schools and churches
    to the creative magic of free labor and
    capital, nothing lies safely beyond the
    reach of the str.uggle.
    Freedom is pitted against slavery;
    light against dark.
    The faith we hold belongs not to us
    alone but to the free of all the world.
    This common bond binds the grower of
    rice in Burma and the planter of wheat
    in Iowa, the shepherd in southern Italy,
    and the mountaineer in the Andes. It
    confers a common dignity upon the
    French soldier who dies in Indochina,
    the British soldier killed ·in Malaya, the
    American life given in Korea.
    We know, beyond this, that we are
    linked to all free peoples not merely by
    a noble idea but by a simple need. No
    free people can for long cling to any
    privilege or enjoy any safety in economic
    solitude. For all our own material
    might, even we need markets in the world
    for the surpluses . of our farms and of
    our factories. Equally, we need for these
    same farms and factories vital materials
    and products of distant lands. This
    basic law of interdependence, so mani-
    fest in the commerce of peace, applies
    with thousandfold intensity in the event
    of war.
    So are we persuaded by necessity and
    by belief that the strength of all free
    peoples lies in unity, their danger in dis-
    corQ.
    To produce this unity, to meet the
    challenge of our time, destiny has laid
    upon our country the responsibility of
    the free world's leadership. So it is
    proper that we assure our friends once
    a·gain that, in the discharge of this re ..
    sponsibility, we Americans know and ob ..
    serve the difference between world lead-
    ership and imperialism; between firm ..
    ness and truculence; between a thought ..
    fully calculated goal and spasmodic re ..
    action to the stimulus of emergencies.
    We wish our friends the world over to
    know this above all: We face the threat-
    not with dread and confusion-but with
    confidence and conviction. [Applause.]
    We feel this moral strength because
    we know that we are not helpless pris-
    oners of history. We are free men. We
    shall remain free, never to be proven ·
    guilty of the one capital offense against
    freedom-a lack of stanch faith.
    In pleading our just cause before the
    bar of history and in pressing our labor
    for world peace, we shall be guided by
    certain fixed principles.
    These principles are :
    (1) Abhorring war as a chosen way to
    balk the purposes of those who threaten
    us, we hold it to be the first task of
    statesmanship to develop the strepgth
    that will deter the forces of aggression
    and promote the conditions of peace.
    For, as it must be the supreme purpose
    of all free men, so it must be the de~i
    cation of their leaders, to save humamty
    :from preying upon itself.
    In the light of this principle, we stand
    ready to engage with any and all others
    in joint effort to remove the causes of
    mutual fear and distrust among nations,
    and so to make possible drastic reduc-
    tion of armaments. The sole requisites
    for undertaking such effort are that, in
    their purpose, they be aimed logically
    and honestly toward securing peace for
    all· and that in their result, they pro-
    vide methods'by which every participat-
    ing nation will prove good faith in carry-
    ing out of its pledge.
    (2) Realizing that common sense and
    common decency alike dictate the futil-
    ity of appeasement, we shall never try
    to placate an aggressor by the false and
    wicked bargain of trading honor for se-
    curity. [Applause.] For in the final
    choice a soldier's pack is not so heavy
    a burden as a prisoner's chains. •
    (3) Knowing that only a United States
    that is strong and immensely produc-
    tive can help defend freedom in our
    world we view our Nation's strength and
    security as a trust upon which rests the
    hope of free men everywhere. It is the
    firm duty of each of our free citizens
    and of every free citizen everywhere to
    place the cause of his country before the
    comfort of himself.
    (4) Honoring the identity and herit-
    age of each nation of the world, we shall
    never use our strength to try to impress
    upon another people our own cherished
    political and economic institutions. [Ap-
    plause.]
    (5) Assessing realistically the needs
    and capacities of proven friends of free-
    dom, we shall strive to help them to
    achieve their own security and well-
    being. Likewise, we shall count upon
    them to assume, within the limits of their
    resources, their full and just burdens in
    the common defense of freedom. [Ap-
    plause.]
    (6) Recognizing economic health as
    an indispensable basis of military
    strength and the free world's peace, we
    shall strive to foster everywhere, and to
    practice ourselves, policies that encour-
    age productivity and profitable trade.
    For the impoverishment of any single
    people in the world means danger to the
    well-being of all other peoples.
    (7) Appreciating that economic need,
    military security, and political wisdom
    combine to suggest regional groupings of
    free peoples, we hope, within the frame-
    work of the United Nations, to help
    strengthen such special bonds the world
    over. The nature of these ties must vary
    with the different problems of different
    areas.
    In the Western Hemisphere, we join
    with all our neighbors in the work of
    perfecting a community of fraternal
    trust and common purpose.
    In Europe, we ask that enlightened and
    inspired leaders of the western nations
    strive with renewed vigor to make the
    unity of their peoples a reality. Only
    as _tree Europe unitedly marshals its
    strength can it effectively safeguard,
    even with our help, its spiritual and cul-
    tural treasures.
    (8) Conceiving the defense of free-
    dom , like freedom itself, to be one and in-
    divisible, we hold all cpntinents and peo"'!
    pies in equal regard and honor. Were-
    ject any insinuation that one race or
    another, one people or another is in any
    sense inferior or · expendable. [Ap-
    plause.]
    (9) Respecting the United Nations as
        the living sign of all peoples' hope for
        peace, we shall strive to make it not
        merely an eloquent symbol but an effec-
        tive force. And in our quest of honor-
        able peace, we shall neither compromise,
        nor tire, nor ever cease.
        By these rules of conduct, we hope
        to be known to all peoples.
        By their observance, an earth of peace
        may become not a vision but a fact.
        This hope-this supreme aspiration-
        must rule the way we live.
        We must be ready to dare all for our
        country. For history does not long en-
        trust the care of freedom to the weak
        or the timid. We must acquire pro-
        ficiency in defense and display stamina
        in purpose.
        We must be willing, individually, and
        as a nation, to accept whatever sacrifices
        may be required of us. A people that
        values its privileges above its principles
        soon loses both.
        These basic precepts are not lofty ab-
        stractions, far removed from matters of
        daily living. They are laws of spiritual
        strength that generate and define our
        material strength. Patriotism means
        equipped forces and a prepared citi-
        zenry. Moral stamina means more en-
        ergy and more productivity, on the farm
        and in the factory. Love of liberty ·
        means the guarding of every resource
        that makes freedom possible-from the
        sanctity of our families and the wealth
        of our soil to the genius of our scientists.
        So each citizen plays an indispensable
        role. The productivity of our heads, our
        hands, and our hearts is the source of
        all the strength we can command, for
        both the enrichment of our lives and the
        winning of peace.
        No person, no home, no community
        can be beyond the reach of this call.
        We are summoned to act in wisdom and
        in conscience; to work with industry, to
        teach with persuasion, to preach with
        conviction, to weigh our every deed ' with
        care and with compassion. For this
        truth must be clear before us: Whatever
        America hopes to bring to pass in the
        world must first come to pass in the heart
        of America.
        The peace we seek, then, is nothing
        less than the practice and the fulfillment
        of our whole faith, among ourselves and
        in our dealings with others. It signifies
        more than stilling the guns, easing the
        sorrow, of war.
        More than an escape from death, it is
        a way of life.
        More than a haven for the weary, it is
        a hope for the brave.
        This is the hope that beckons us on-
        ward in this century of trial. This is
        the work that awaits us all, to be done
        with bravery, with charity, and with
        prayer to Almighty God. [Great ap-
        plause.]
