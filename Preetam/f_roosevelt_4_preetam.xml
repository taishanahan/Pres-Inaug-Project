    <introduction>Franklin D. Roosevelt Fourth Inaugural Address Saturday, January 20,
        1945</introduction>

    <speech>
        <paragraph>MR. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, my friends, you will understand and, I
            believe, agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be simple and its words
            brief.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We Americans of today, together with our allies, are passing through a period of
            supreme test. It is a test of our courage--of our resolve--of our wisdom--our essential
            democracy.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>If we meet that test--successfully and honorably--we shall perform a service of
            historic importance which men and women and children will honor throughout all
            time.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>As I stand here today, having taken the solemn oath of office in the presence of
            my fellow countrymen--in the presence of our God--I know that it is America's purpose
            that we shall not fail.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>In the days and in the years that are to come we shall work for a just and
            honorable peace, a durable peace, as today we work and fight for total victory in
            war.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We can and we will achieve such a peace.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We shall strive for perfection. We shall not achieve it immediately--but we still
            shall strive. We may make mistakes--but they must never be mistakes which result from
            faintness of heart or abandonment of moral principle.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>I remember that my old schoolmaster, Dr. Peabody, said, in days that seemed to us
            then to be secure and untroubled: "Things in life will not always run smoothly.
            Sometimes we will be rising toward the heights--then all will seem to reverse itself and
            start downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is
            forever upward; that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the
            centuries always has an upward trend."</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Our Constitution of 1787 was not a perfect instrument; it is not perfect yet. But
            it provided a firm base upon which all manner of men, of all races and colors and
            creeds, could build our solid structure of democracy.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>And so today, in this year of war, 1945, we have learned lessons--at a fearful
            cost--and we shall profit by them.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-being is
            dependent on the well-being of other nations far away. We have learned that we must live
            as men, not as ostriches, nor as dogs in the manger.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the human
            community.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said, that "The only way to have a
            friend is to be one."</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and mistrust or
            with fear. We can gain it only if we proceed with the understanding, the confidence, and
            the courage which flow from conviction.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Almighty God has blessed our land in many ways. He has given our people stout
            hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth. He has
            given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished
            world.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>So we pray to Him now for the vision to see our way clearly--to see the way that
            leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men--to the achievement of
            His will to peace on earth.</paragraph>
