    President REAGAN. Senator HATIELD,
    Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice
    President BusH, Vice President MoNDALE,
    Senator BAKER, Speaker O'NEILL, Rev-
    erend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens:
    To a few of us here today, this is a
    solemn and most momentous occasion.
    And, yet, in the history of our Nation,
    it is a commonplace occurrence.
    The orderly transfer of authority as
    called for in the Constitution routinely
    takes place as it has for almost two cen-
    turies and few of us stop to think how
    unique we reallv are. In the eyes of many
    in the world, this every-4-year ceremony
    ·we accept as normal is nothing less
    than a miracle.
    Mr. President, I want our fellow citi-
    zens to know how much you did to carry
    on this tradition. By your gracious co-
    operation in the transition process, you
    have shown a watching world that we
    are a united people pledged to maintain-
    ing a political system which guarantees
    individual liberty to a greater degree
    than any other, and I thank you and
    your people for all your help in main-
    taining the continuity which is the bul-
    wark of our Republic.
    [Applause.]
    The business of our Nation goes for-
    ward. These United States are con-
    fronted with an economic affliction of
    great proportions. We suffer from the
    longest and one of the worst sustained
    inflations in our national history. It dis-
    torts our economic -decisions, penalizes
    thrift, and crushes the struggling young
    and the fixed-income elderly alike. It
    threatens to shatter the lives of mil-
    lions of our people.
    Idle industries have cast workers into
    unemployment, causing human misery
    and personal indignity. Those who do
    work are denied a fair return for their
    labor by a tax system which penalizes
    successful achievement and keeps us
    from maintaining full productivity.
    But great as our tax burden is, it has
    not kept pace with public spending. For
    decades, we have piled deficit upon
    deficit, mortgaging our future and our
    children's future for the temporary con-
    venience of the present. To continue this
    long trend is to guarantee tremendous
    social, cultural, political, and economic
    upheavals.
    You and I, as individuals, can, by bor-
    rowing, live beyond our means, but for
    only a limited period of time. Why, then,
    should we think that collectively, as a
    nation, we are not bound by that same
    limitation?
    We must act today in order to preserve
    tomorrow. And let there be no misunder-
    standing-we are going to begin to act,
    beginning today.
    The economic ills we suffer have come
    upon us over several decades. They will
    not go away in days, weeks, or months.
    But they will go away. They will go away
    because we, as Americans, have the ca-
    pacity now, as we have had in the past, to
    do whatever needs to be done to preserve
    this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
    In this present crisis, Government is
    not the solution to our problem. Govern-
    ment is the problem . .
    From time to time, we have been
    tempted to believe that society has be-
    come too complex to be managed by self-
    rule, that government by an elite group
    is superior to government for, by, and of
    the people. But if no one among us is
    capable of governing himself, then who
    among us has the capacity to govern
    someone else?
    All of us together, in and out of Gov-
    ernment, must bear the burden. The so-
    lutions we seek must be equitable, with
    no one group singled out to pay a higher
    price.
    We hear much of special interest
    groups. Our concern must be for a spe-
    cial interest group that has been too long
    neglected. It knows no sectional bound-
    aries or ethnic a.nd racial divisions, and
    it crosses political party lines. It is made
    up of men and women who raise our food,
    patrol our streets, man our mines and
    our factories, teach our children, keep
    our homes, and heal us when we are
    sick-professionals, industrialists, shop-
    keepers, clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers.
    They are, in short, "We the people," this
    breed called Americans.
    This administration's objective will be
    a healthy, vigorous, growing economy
    that provides equal opportunity for all
    Americans, with no barriers born of
    bigotry or discrimination. Putting Amer-
    ica back to work means putting all Amer-
    icans back to work. Ending infiation
    means freeing all Americans from the
    terror of runaway living costs. All must
    share in the productive work of this "new
    beginning" and all must share in the
    bounty of a revived economy. With the
    idealism and fairplay which are the core
    of our system and our strength, we can
    have a strong and prosperous America at
    peace with itself and the world.
    So, as we begin, let us take inventory.
    We are a Nation that has a Govern-
    ment-not the other way around. And
    this makes us special among the na-
    tions of the Earth. Our Government has
    no power except that granted it by the
    people. It is time to check and reverse
    the growth of Government which shows
    signs of having grown beyond the con-
    sent of the governed.
    It is mv intention to curb the size and
    influence of the Federal Establishment
    and to demand recognition of the dis-
    tinction be·tween the powers granted to
    the Federal Government and those re-
    served to the States or to the people.
    [Applause.]
    All of us need to be reminded that the
    Federal Government did not create the
    States; the States created the Federal
    Government.
    [Applause.]
    So there will be no misunderstanding,
    it is not my intention to do away with
    government. It is, rather, to make it
    work-work with us, not over us; to
    stand by our side, not ride on our back.
    Government can and must provide op-
    portunity, not smother it; foster produc-
    tivity, not stifle it.
    If we look to the answer as to why, for
    so many years, we achieved so much,
    prospered as no other people on earth,
    it was because here, in this land, we un-
    leashed the energy and individual genius
    of man to a greater extent than has ever
    been done before. Freedom and the dig-
    nity of the individual have been more
    available and assured here than in any
    other place on earth. The price for this
    freedom at times has been high. But we
    have never been unwilling to pay that
    price.
    It is no coincidence that our present
    troubles parallel and are proportionate
    to the intervention and intrusion in our
    lives that result from unnecessary and
    excessive growth of government.
    It 1s time for us to realize that we are
    too great a nation to limit ourselves to
    small dreams. We are not, as some would
    have us believe, doomed to an inevitable
    decline. I do not · believe in a fate that
    will fall on us no matter what we do. I
    do believe in a fate that will fall on us
    if we do nothing.
    So, with all the creative energy at our
    command, let us begin an era of national
    renewal. Let us renew our determination,
    our courage, and our strength. And let
    us renew our faith and our hope. We
    have every right to dream heroic dreams.
    Those who say that we are in a time
    when there are no heroes just don't know
    where to look. You can see heroes every
    day going in and out of factory gates.
    Others, a handful in number, produce
    enough food to feed all of us and then the
    world beyond.
    You meet heroes across a counter-and
    they are on both sides of that counter.
    There are entrepreneurs with faith in
    themselves and faith in an idea who cre-
    ate new jobs, new wealth and oppor-
    tunity. They are individuals and fami-
    lies whose taxes support the Government
    and whose voluntary gifts support
    church, charity, culture, art, and edu-
    cation. Their patriotism is quiet but
    deep. Their values sustain our national
    life.
    I have used the words "they" and
    "their'' in speaking of these heroes. I
    could say "you" and "your" because I am
    addressing the heroes of whom I speak-
    you, the citizens of this blessed land.
    Your dreams, your hopes, your goals, are
    going to be the dreams, the hopes and
    the goals of this administration, so help
    me God.
    [Applause.]
    We shall reflect the compassion that
    is so much a part of your makeup. How
    can we love our country and not love our
    countrymen? And loving them reach out
    a hand when they fall, heal them when
    they are sick, and provide opportunities
    to make them self -sufficient so they will
    be equal in fact and not just in theory?
    Can we solve the problems confront-
    ing us? Well, the answer is an unequivo-
    cal and emphatic yes. To paraphrase
    Winston Churchill, I did not take the
    oath I have just taken with the intention
    of presiding over the dissolution of the
    world's strongest economy.
    In the days ahead, I will propose re-
    moving the roadblocks that have slowed
    our economy and reduced productivity.
    Steps will be taken aimed at restoring
    the balance between the various levels
    of government. Progress may be slow-
    measured in inches and feet, not miles-
    but we will progress. It is time to re-
    awaken this industrial giant, to get Gov-
    ernment back within its means, and to
    lighten our punitive tax burden. And
    these will be our :first priorities, and on
    these principles, there will be no com-
    promise.
    [Applause. J
    On the eve of our struggle for inde-
    pendence a man who might have been
    one of the greatest among the Founding
    Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, Pres!dent
    of the Massachusetts Congress, said to
    his fellow Americans, "Our country is in
    danger, but not to be despaired of ... On
    you depend the fortunes of America. You
    are to decide the important question
    upon which rests the happiness and the
    liberty of millions yet unborn. Act wor-
    thy of yourselves."
    Well, I believe we, the Americans of
    today, are ready to act worthy of our-
    selves, ready to do what must be done
    to ensure happiness and liberty for our-
    selves, our children and our children's
    children.
    And as we renew ourselves here in our
    own land, we will be seen as having
    greater strength throughout the world.
    We will again be the exemplar of free-
    dom and a beacon of hope for those who
    do not now have freedom.
    To those neighbors and allies who
    share our freedom, we will strengthen
    our historic ties and assure them of our
    support and firm commitment. We will
    match loyalty with loyalty. We will
    strive for mutually ben"ficial relations.
    We will not use our friendship to im-
    pose on their sovereignty, for our own
    sovereignty is not for sale.
    As for the enemies of freedom, those
    who are potential adversaries, they will
    be reminded that peace is the highest
    aspiration of the American people. We
    will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we
    will not surrender for it-now or ever.
    [Applause.]
    Our forebearance should never be mis-
    understood. Our reluctance for conflict
    should not be misjudged as a failure of
    will. When action is required to preserve
    our national security, we will act. we will
    maintain sufficient strength to prevail
    if need be, knowing that if we do so we
    have the best chance of never having to
    use that strength.
    Above all we must realize that no ar-
    senal, or no weapon in the arsenals of
    the world, is so formidable as the will
    and moral courage of free men and
    women. It is a weapon our adversaries in
    today's world do not have. It is a weapon
    that we as Americans do have. Let that
    be understood by those who practice ter-
    rorism and prey upon their neighbors.
    [Applause.]
    I am told that tens of thousands of
    prayer meetings are being held on this
    day, and for that I am deeply grateful.
    We are a Nation under God, and I be-
    lieve God intended for us to be free. It
    would be fitting and good, I think, if on
    each Inaugural Day in future years it
    should be declared a day of prayer.
    This is the :first time in our history
    that this ceremony has been held, as you
    have been told, on this West Front of the
    Capitol. Standing here, one faces a
    magnificent vista, opening up on this
    city's special beauty and history. At the
    end of this open Mall are those shrines
    to the giants on whose shoulders we
    stand. ·
    Directly in front of me, the monument
    to a monumental man: George Wash-
    ington, Father of our country. A man of
    humility who came to greatness re-
    luctantly. He led Ainerica out of revolu- -
    tionary victory into infant nationhood.
    Off to one side, the stately memorial
    to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of
    Independence fiames with his eloquence.
    And then beyond the refiecting pool
    the dignified columns of the Lincoln
    Memorial. Whoever would understand
    in his heart the meaning of America will
    find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.
    Bevond those monuments to heroism
    is the Potom~c River, and on the far
    shore the sloping hills of Arlington Na-
    tional Cemetery with its row on row of
    simple white markers bearing crosses or
    Stars of David. They add up to only a
    tiny fraction of the price that has been
    paid for our freedom.
    Each one of those markers is a monu-
    ment to the kinds of hero I spoke of
    earlier. Their lives ended in places called
    Belleau Wood, The Argonne, Omaha
    Beach, Salerno and halfway around the
    wOTld on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork
    Chop Hill, The Chosin Reservior, and in
    a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a
    place called Vietnam.
    Under one such marker lies a young
    man-Martin Treptow-who left his job
    in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go
    to France with the famed Rainbow Divi-
    sion. There, on the Western lront, he
    was killed trying to carry a message be-
    tween battalions under heavy artillery
    fire.
    We are told that on his body was
    found a diary. On the flyleaf under the
    heading, "My Pledge," he had written
    these words: "America must win this
    war. Therefore, I will work, I will save, I
    will sacrifice, I will endure, I will :fight
    cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the
    issue of the whole struggle depended on
    me alone."
    The crisis we are facing today does not
    require of us the kind of sacrifice that
    Martin Treptow and so many thousands
    of others were called upon to make. It
    does require, however, our best effort,
    and our willingness to believe in our-
    selves and to believe in our capacity to
    perform grE:at deeds; to believe that to-
    gether, with God's help, we can and will
    resolve the problems which now confront
    us. And, after all, why shouldn't we be-
    lieve that? We are Americans. God bless
    you and thank you.
