    <introduction>Donald Trump First Inaugural Address Friday, <date>January
        20,2017</date></introduction>
    <speech>
        <paragraph>Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, Presi- dent Bush,
            President Obama, fellow Ameri- cans, and people of the world, thank you. We, the
            citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country
            and restore its promise for all of our people. Together we will determine the course of
            America and the world for many, many years to come.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we will get the job
            done. </paragraph>

        <paragraph>Every 4 years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful
            transfer of power. <pred tone="P">And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady
                Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transi- tion. They have been
                magnificent.</pred></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Today’s ceremony, however, has very spe- cial meaning because today we are not
            mere- ly transferring power from one administra- tion to another or from one party to
            another, but we are transferring power from Wash- ington, DC, and giving it back to you,
            the people.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>For too long, a small group in our Nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of
            govern- ment while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people
            did not share in its wealth. Politicians pros- pered, but the jobs left and the
            factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our
            country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your
            triumphs, and while they celebrated in our Nation’s Cap- ital, there was little to
            celebrate for strug- gling families all across our land.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">That all changes starting right here and right now, because this
                moment is your mo- ment. It belongs to you. It belongs to every- one gathered here
                today and everyone watch- ing all across America. This is your day. This is your
                celebration. This, the United States of America, is your
            country.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>What truly matters is not which party con- trols our government but whether our
            gov- ernment is controlled by the people. <unity tone="P">January 20, 2017, will be
                remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this Nation
            again.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>The forgotten men and women of our coun- try will be forgotten no longer.
            Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a
            historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of
            this mo- ment is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
                <education tone="N">Americans want great schools for their children</education>,
            safe neigh- borhoods for their families, and <jobs tone="N">good jobs for
                themselves</jobs>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.
            But for too many of our citizens, a different re- ality exists: mothers and children
            trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out fac- tories scattered like tombstones
            across the landscape of our Nation, <education tone="N">an education sys- tem flush with
                cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all
                knowledge</education>, <criminal_justice tone="N">the crime and the gangs and the
                drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized
                po- tential</criminal_justice>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one Nation and
            their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams. Their success will be our success.
            We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today
            is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades we have enriched foreign in-
            dustry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries,
            while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We have defended other nations’ borders, while refusing to defend our own, and
                <economy tone="N">spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s
                infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay</economy>. We have made other
            countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated
            over the horizon.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="N">One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with
                not even a thought about the millions and millions of American work- ers that were
                left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and
                then redistributed all across the world.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>But that is the past. <unity tone="P">Now, we are looking only to the future. We
                assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every
                foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision
                will govern our land. From this day forward, it is going to be only America
                first—America first.</unity> Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on
            foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American
            families.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We must protect our borders from the rav- ages of other countries making our
            products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great
            prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will
            never, ever let you down. <unity tone="P">America will start winning again, winning like
                never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our bor- ders. We will
                bring back our wealth. We will bring back our dreams.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and
            rail- ways all across our wonderful Nation. We will get our people off of welfare and
            back to work rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will
            follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we do so
            with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests
            first.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as
            an exam- ple. We will shine for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and
            form new ones and <war>unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism,
                which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the
                United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover
                our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to pa- triotism, there is no
                room for prejudice</unity>. <religion>The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is
                when God’s people live together in unity.</religion> We must speak our minds openly,
            debate our dis- agreements honestly, but always pursue soli- darity.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">When America is united, America is to- tally unstoppable</unity>.
            There should be no fear. We are protected, and we will always be pro- tected. We will be
            protected by the great men and women of our military and law en- forcement and, most
            importantly, we will <religion>be protected by God</religion>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that
            a na- tion is only living as long as it is striving.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly
            com- plaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now
            arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No
            challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our
            country will thrive and prosper again.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of
            space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies,
            industries, and technologies of tomorrow. <unity tone="P"> A new national pride will
                stir our soul, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget—that
            whether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We
            all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all sa- lute the same great American
            flag.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of
            Ne- braska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same
            dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same Almighty
            Creator.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large,
                from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words. You will never be
                ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will de- fine our American
                destiny, and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
                Together, we will make America strong again. We will make Amer- ica wealthy again.
                We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes,
                together we will make America great again.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you.</paragraph>
