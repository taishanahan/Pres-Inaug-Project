    <introduction>Joe Biden Inaugural Address Wednesday, <date>January 20, 2021</date></introduction>
    <speech>
        <paragraph>Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer,
            Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow
            Americans.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">This is America’s day.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>This is democracy’s day.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">A day of history and hope.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Of renewal and resolve.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has
            risen to the challenge.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of
            democracy.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been
            heeded.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>We have learned again that democracy is precious.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>Democracy is fragile.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>And at this hour, my friends, democracy has
            prevailed.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence
                sought to shake this Capitol’s very foundation, we come together as one nation,
                under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for
                more than two centuries.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set
            our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><pred tone="P">I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence
                here.</pred></paragraph>

        <paragraph>I thank them from the bottom of my heart.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of
                our nation.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><pred tone="P">As does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us
            today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.</pred></paragraph>

        <paragraph>I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took — an oath first
            sworn by George Washington.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on
            all of us.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>On “We the People” who seek a more perfect Union.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">This is a great nation and we are a good
            people.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so
            far. But we still have far to go.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this
            winter of peril and possibility.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Much to repair.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Much to restore.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Much to heal.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Much to build.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>And much to gain.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">Few periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than
            the one we’re in now.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="N">A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country.</public_health></paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="N">It’s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War
            II.</public_health></paragraph>

        <paragraph><jobs tone="N">Millions of jobs have been lost.</jobs></paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="N">Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><race>A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of
            justice for all will be deferred no longer.</race></paragraph>

        <paragraph>A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more
            desperate or any more clear.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that
            we must confront and we will defeat.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">To overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of
            America – requires more than words.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy:</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Unity.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Unity.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>In another January in Washington, on New Year’s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed
            the Emancipation Proclamation.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>When he put pen to paper, the President said, “If my name ever goes down into
            history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.”</paragraph>

        <paragraph>My whole soul is in it.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Bringing America together.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Uniting our people.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And uniting our nation.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">I ask every American to join me in this cause.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Uniting to fight the common foes we face:</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">Anger, resentment, hatred.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><criminal_justice tone="N">Extremism, lawlessness, violence.</criminal_justice></paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="N">Disease,</public_health> 
            <jobs tone="N">joblessness, hopelessness.</jobs></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">With unity we can do great things. Important things.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>We can right wrongs.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><jobs tone="P">We can put people to work in good jobs.</jobs></paragraph>

        <paragraph><education tone="P">We can teach our children in safe
            schools.</education></paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="P">We can overcome this deadly
            virus.</public_health></paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="P">We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health
                care secure for all.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><race>We can deliver racial justice.</race></paragraph>

        <paragraph>We can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the
            world.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>But I also know they are not new.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are
            all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and
            demonization have long torn us apart.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>The battle is perennial.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Victory is never assured.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11,
                through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our “better angels” have always
                prevailed.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us
            forward.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And, we can do so now.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We can treat each other with dignity and respect.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>No progress, only exhausting outrage.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>No nation, only a state of chaos.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is
                the path forward.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And, we must meet this moment as the United States of America.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted
            together.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>And so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>All of us.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Let us listen to one another.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Hear one another. See one another.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Show respect to one another.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="N">Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">And, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even
            manufactured.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">America has to be better than this.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And, I believe America is better than this.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Just look around.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Here we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil
            War, when the Union itself hung in the balance.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Yet we endured and we prevailed.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><race>Here we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his
            dream.</race></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors
            tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to
            national office – Vice President Kamala Harris.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Don’t tell me things can’t change.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="N">Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery, where heroes
            who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence
            to silence the will of the people</unity>, <democracy>to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us
            from this sacred ground.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>That did not happen.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>It will never happen.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Not today.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Not tomorrow.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Not ever.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed
            in us.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move
            forward. Take a measure of me and my heart.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>And if you still disagree, so be it.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>That’s democracy. That’s America. The right to dissent peaceably,
                within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our nation’s greatest
                strength.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who
            did.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><religion>Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people
            was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love.</religion></paragraph>

        <paragraph>What are the common objects we love that define us as Americans?</paragraph>

        <paragraph>I think I know.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Opportunity.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Security.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Liberty.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Dignity.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Respect.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Honor.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>And, yes, the truth.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>There is truth and there are lies.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Lies told for power and for profit.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and
            especially as leaders – leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect
            our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>I understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and
            trepidation.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><jobs tone="N">I understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families,
            about what comes next.</jobs></paragraph>

        <paragraph>I get it.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions,
            distrusting those who don’t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don’t get
            their news from the same sources you do.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban,
            conservative versus liberal.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our
                hearts.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>If we show a little tolerance and humility.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>If we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes just for a moment. Because
            here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal
            you.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>There are some days when we need a hand.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">There are other days when we’re called on to lend
            one.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">That is how we must be with one another.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more
            ready for the future.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each
            other.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="N">We are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the
            virus.</public_health></paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="N">We must set aside the politics and finally face this
                pandemic as one nation</public_health>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><religion>I promise you this: as the Bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy
            cometh in the morning.</religion></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We will get through this, together.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>The world is watching today.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we
            have come out stronger for it.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our
            example.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and
            security.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>We have been through so much in this nation.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="N">And, in my first act as President, I would like to ask you to join me in a moment
            of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the
            pandemic.</public_health></paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="N">To those 400,000 fellow Americans – mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons
            and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers.</public_health></paragraph>

        <paragraph>We will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should
            be.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><religion>Let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left
            behind, and for our country.</religion></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Amen.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>This is a time of testing.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>We face an attack on democracy and on truth.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="N">A raging virus.</public_health></paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="N">Growing inequity.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><race>The sting of systemic racism.</race></paragraph>

        <paragraph>A climate in crisis.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>America’s role in the world.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest
            of responsibilities.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Now we must step up.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">All of us.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>And, this is certain.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our
            era.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Will we rise to the occasion?</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Will we master this rare and difficult hour?</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our
            children?</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">I believe we must and I believe we will.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And when we do, we will write the next chapter in the American story.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>It’s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to
            me.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>It’s called “American Anthem” and there is one verse stands out for
            me:</paragraph>

        <paragraph>“The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day What shall be our
            legacy? What will our children say?… Let me know in my heart When my days are through
            America America I gave my best to you.”</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our
            nation.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>If we do this then when our days are through our children and our children’s
            children will say of us they gave their best.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>They did their duty.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>They healed a broken land. My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with
            a sacred oath.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><religion>Before God and all of you I give you my word.</religion></paragraph>

        <paragraph>I will always level with you.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>I will defend the Constitution.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>I will defend our democracy.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>I will defend America.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>I will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of
            possibilities.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Not of personal interest, but of the public good.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not
                fear.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">Of unity, not division.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Of light, not darkness.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>An American story of decency and dignity.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Of love and of healing.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Of greatness and of goodness.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">May this be the story that guides us.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">The story that inspires us.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">The story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of
            history.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">We met the moment.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>That democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but
            thrived.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">That our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the
            world.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to
            follow.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>So, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Sustained by faith.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Driven by conviction.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">And, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all
                our hearts.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>May God bless America and may God protect our troops.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Thank you, America.</paragraph>
