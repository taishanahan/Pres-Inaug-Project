    <introduction>Harry S. Truman Inaugural Address Thursday, <date>January 20,
        1949</date></introduction>
    <speech>
        <paragraph>Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, and fellow citizens, I accept with
            humility the honor which the American people have conferred upon me. I accept it with a
            deep resolve to do all that I can for the welfare of this Nation and for the peace of
            the world.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="P">In performing the duties of my office, I need the help and prayers of every one
            of you. I ask for your encouragement and your support. The tasks we face are difficult,
            and we can accomplish them only if we work together.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Each period of our national history has had its special challenges. Those that
            confront us now are as momentous as any in the past. Today marks the beginning not only
            of a new administration, but of a period that will be eventful, perhaps decisive, for us
            and for the world.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="N">It may be our lot to experience, and in large measure to bring about, a major
            turning point in the long history of the human race. The first half of this century has
            been marked by unprecedented and brutal attacks on the rights of man, and by the two
            most frightful wars in history. The supreme need of our time is for men to learn to live
            together in peace and harmony.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>The peoples of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty, composed almost
            equally of great hopes and great fears. In this time of doubt, they look to the United
            States as never before for good will, strength, and wise leadership.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>It is fitting, therefore, that we take this occasion to proclaim to the world the
            essential principles of the faith by which we live, and to declare our aims to all
            peoples.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>The American people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this Nation from
            the beginning. We believe that all men have a right to equal justice under law and equal
            opportunity to share in the common good. We believe that all men have the right to
            freedom of thought and expression.</democracy> <religion>We believe that all men are created equal because
            they are created in the image of God.</religion></paragraph>

        <paragraph><religion>From this faith we will not be moved.</religion></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>The American people desire, and are determined to work for, a world in which all
            nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they see fit, and to achieve a
            decent and satisfying life. Above all else, our people desire, and are determined to
            work for, peace on earth--a just and lasting peace--based on genuine agreement freely
            arrived at by equals.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>In the pursuit of these aims, the United States and other like-minded nations
            find themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims and a totally different
            concept of life.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>That regime adheres to a false philosophy which purports to offer freedom,
            security, and greater opportunity to mankind. Misled by this philosophy, many peoples
            have sacrificed their liberties only to learn to their sorrow that deceit and mockery,
            poverty and tyranny, are their reward.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>That false philosophy is communism.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>Communism is based on the belief that man is so weak and inadequate that he is
            unable to govern himself, and therefore requires the rule of strong masters.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual
            capacity, as well as the inalienable right, to govern himself with reason and
            justice.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>Communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause, punishment
            without trial, and forced labor as the chattel of the state. It decrees what information
            he shall receive, what art he shall produce, what leaders he shall follow, and what
            thoughts he shall think.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>Democracy maintains that government is established for the benefit of the
            individual, and is charged with the responsibility of protecting the rights of the
            individual and his freedom in the exercise of his abilities.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>Communism maintains that social wrongs can be corrected only by
            violence.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>Democracy has proved that social justice can be achieved through peaceful
            change.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>Communism holds that the world is so deeply divided into opposing classes that
            war is inevitable.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>Democracy holds that free nations can settle differences justly and maintain
            lasting peace.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>These differences between communism and democracy do not concern the United
            States alone. People everywhere are coming to realize that what is involved is material
            well-being, human dignity, and the right to believe in and worship God.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>I state these differences, not to draw issues of belief as such, but because the
            actions resulting from the Communist philosophy are a threat to the efforts of free
            nations to bring about world recovery and lasting peace.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>Since the end of hostilities, the United States has invested its substance and
            its energy in a great constructive effort to restore peace, stability, and freedom to
            the world.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>We have sought no territory and we have imposed our will on none. We have asked
            for no privileges we would not extend to others.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>We have constantly and vigorously supported the United Nations and related
            agencies as a means of applying democratic principles to international relations. We
            have consistently advocated and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among
            nations.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="N">We have made every effort to secure agreement on effective international control
            of our most powerful weapon, and we have worked steadily for the limitation and control
            of all armaments.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><trade>We have encouraged, by precept and example, the expansion of world trade on a
            sound and fair basis.</trade></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>Almost a year ago, in company with 16 free nations of Europe, we launched the
            greatest cooperative economic program in history.</diplomacy> <democracy>The purpose of that unprecedented
            effort is to invigorate and strengthen democracy in Europe, so that the free people of
            that continent can resume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can
            contribute once more to the security and welfare of the world.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>Our efforts have brought new hope to all mankind. We have beaten back despair and
            defeatism. We have saved a number of countries from losing their liberty. Hundreds of
            millions of people all over the world now agree with us, that we need not have war--that
            we can have peace.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>The initiative is ours.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>We are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure of
            international order and justice. We shall have as our partners countries which, no
            longer solely concerned with the problem of national survival, are now working to
            improve the standards of living of all their people. We are ready to undertake new
            projects to strengthen the free world.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>In the coming years, our program for peace and freedom will emphasize four major
            courses of action.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>First, we will continue to give unfaltering support to the United Nations and
            related agencies, and we will continue to search for ways to strengthen their authority
            and increase their effectiveness. We believe that the United Nations will be
            strengthened by the new nations which are being formed in lands now advancing toward
            self-government under democratic principles.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="P">Second, we will continue our programs for world economic recovery.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="P">This means, first of all, that we must keep our full weight behind the European
            recovery program. We are confident of the success of this major venture in world
            recovery. We believe that our partners in this effort will achieve the status of
            self-supporting nations once again.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><trade>In addition, we must carry out our plans for reducing the barriers to world trade
            and increasing its volume. Economic recovery and peace itself depend on increased world
            trade.</trade></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">Third, we will strengthen freedom-loving nations against the dangers of
            aggression.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">We are now working out with a number of countries a joint agreement designed to
            strengthen the security of the North Atlantic area. Such an agreement would take the
            form of a collective defense arrangement within the terms of the United Nations
            Charter.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">We have already established such a defense pact for the Western Hemisphere by the
            treaty of Rio de Janeiro.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">The primary purpose of these agreements is to provide unmistakable proof of the
            joint determination of the free countries to resist armed attack from any quarter. Each
            country participating in these arrangements must contribute all it can to the common
            defense.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">If we can make it sufficiently clear, in advance, that any armed attack affecting
            our national security would be met with overwhelming force, the armed attack might never
            occur.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph><congress>I hope soon to send to the Senate a treaty respecting the North Atlantic security
            plan.</congress></paragraph>

        <paragraph><war tone="P">In addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which
            will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security.</war></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Fourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our
            scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of
            underdeveloped areas.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><public_health tone="N">More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching
            misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease.</public_health> <economy tone="N">Their economic life is
            primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to
            more prosperous areas.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to
            relieve the suffering of these people.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="P">The United States is pre-eminent among nations in the development of industrial
            and scientific techniques. The material resources which we can afford to use for the
            assistance of other peoples are limited. But our imponderable resources in technical
            knowledge are constantly growing and are inexhaustible.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>I believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of
            our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a
            better life. And, in cooperation with other nations, we should foster capital investment
            in areas needing development.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>Our aim should be to help the free peoples of the world, through their own
            efforts, to produce more food, more clothing, more materials for housing, and more
            mechanical power to lighten their burdens.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><diplomacy>We invite other countries to pool their technological resources in this
            undertaking. Their contributions will be warmly welcomed. This should be a cooperative
            enterprise in which all nations work together through the United Nations and its
            specialized agencies wherever practicable. It must be a worldwide effort for the
            achievement of peace, plenty, and freedom.</diplomacy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="N">With the cooperation of business, private capital, agriculture, and labor in this
            country, this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other nations and
            can raise substantially their standards of living.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="N">Such new economic developments must be devised and controlled to benefit the
            peoples of the areas in which they are established. Guarantees to the investor must be
            balanced by guarantees in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go
            into these developments.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>The old imperialism--exploitation for foreign profit--has no place in our plans.
            What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic
            fair-dealing.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><regulation>All countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a constructive
            program for the better use of the world's human and natural resources.</regulation> Experience shows
            that our commerce with other countries expands as they progress industrially and
            economically.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="N">Greater production is the key to prosperity and peace. And the key to greater
            production is a wider and more vigorous application of modern scientific and technical
            knowledge.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><unity tone="N">Only by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the
            human family achieve the decent, satisfying life that is the right of all
            people.</unity></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>Democracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the peoples of the world
            into triumphant action, not only against their human oppressors, but also against their
            ancient enemies--hunger, misery, and despair.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>On the basis of these four major courses of action we hope to help create the
            conditions that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all
            mankind.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="P">If we are to be successful in carrying out these policies, it is clear that we
            must have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves
            strong.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><economy tone="P">Slowly but surely we are weaving a world fabric of international security and
            growing prosperity.</economy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>We are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear--even by those who live
            today in fear under their own governments.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We are aided by all who want relief from the lies of propaganda--who desire truth
            and sincerity.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>We are aided by all who desire self-government and a voice in deciding their own
            affairs.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph>We are aided by all who long for economic security--for the security and
            abundance that men in free societies can enjoy.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We are aided by all who desire freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and
            freedom to live their own lives for useful ends.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Our allies are the millions who hunger and thirst after
            righteousness.</paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>In due time, as our stability becomes manifest, as more and more nations come to
            know the benefits of democracy and to participate in growing abundance, I believe that
            those countries which now oppose us will abandon their delusions and join with the free
            nations of the world in a just settlement of international differences.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>Events have brought our American democracy to new influence and new
            responsibilities. They will test our courage, our devotion to duty, and our concept of
            liberty.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><democracy>But I say to all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in
            greater liberty.</democracy></paragraph>

        <paragraph><religion>Steadfast in our faith in the Almighty, we will advance toward a world where
            man's freedom is secure.</religion></paragraph>

        <paragraph>To that end we will devote our strength, our resources, and our firmness of
            resolve. With God's help, the future of mankind will be assured in a world of justice,
            harmony, and peace.</paragraph>
